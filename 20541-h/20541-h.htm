<p>The advertisement to a work of similar character to the 
present expresses the author&rsquo;s principle and wishes as to 
this little volume.&nbsp; It is constructed on the same plan, 
and, like the former, has had the test of the observations of his
own children before it was given to the public.&nbsp; The 
reception of &ldquo;Agathos&rdquo; has shewn that many parents 
have felt the want which these little volumes are intended to 
supply, and leads the author to hope that he has in some measure 
been able to meet it.</p>
<p><!-- page iv--><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
iv</span>It is a peculiar gratification to him to be able thus to
enter many a Christian household, and fulfil, in some measure, 
his Master&rsquo;s charge, &ldquo;Feed my lambs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May it please God to give His blessing to this new 
attempt.</p>

<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
1</span>The Rocky Island.</h2>
<p>I saw in my dream a rough rocky island rising straight out of 
the midst of a roaring sea.&nbsp; In the midst of the island rose
a black steep mountain; dark clouds rested gloomily upon its top;
and into the midst of the clouds it cast forth ever and anon red 
flames, which lit them up like the thick curling smoke at the top
of a furnace-chimney.&nbsp; Peals of loud thunder sounded 
constantly from these thick clouds; and now and then angry 
lightning shot its forked tongue, white, and red, and blue, from 
the midst of them, and fell upon the rocks, or the few trees 
which just clung to their sides, splitting them violently down, 
and scattering the broken and shivered pieces on all sides.&nbsp;
<!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
2</span>It was a sad, dreary-looking island at the first view, 
and I thought that no one could dwell in it; but as I looked 
closer at its shores, I saw that they were covered with children 
at play.&nbsp; A soft white sand formed its beach, and there 
these children played.&nbsp; I saw no grown people among them; 
but the children were all busy&mdash;some picking up shells; some
playing with the bright-coloured berries of a prickly dwarf-plant
which grew upon those sands; some watching the waves as they ran 
up and then fell back again on that shore; some running after the
sea-birds, which ran with quick light feet along the wet sand, 
and ever flew off, skimming just along the wave-top, and uttering
a quick sharp note as the children came close upon them:&mdash;so
some sported in one way, and some in another, but all were busily
at play.&nbsp; Now I wondered in my dream to see these children 
thus busy whilst the burning mountain lay close behind <!-- page 
3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>them, 
and the thunder made the air ring.</p>
<p>Sometimes, indeed, when it shone out redder and fiercer than 
usual, or when the thunder seemed close over their heads, the 
children would be startled for a little while, and run together, 
and cry, and scream; but very soon it was all forgotten, and they
were as full of their sports as ever.</p>
<p>While I was musing upon this, I saw a man appear suddenly 
amongst the children.&nbsp; He was of a noble and kingly 
countenance, and yet so gentle withal that there was not a child 
of them all who seemed afraid to look in his face, or to listen 
to his kind voice when he opened his mouth, for soon I found that
he was speaking to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear children,&rdquo; I 
heard him say, &ldquo;you will all be certainly killed, if you 
stay upon this rocky island.&nbsp; Here no one ever grows up 
happily.&nbsp; Here all play turns into death&mdash;the burning 
mountain, <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and the forked lightning, and the 
dreadful breath of the hill-storm,&mdash;these sweep down over 
all that stay here, and slay them all; and if you stay here, for 
these childish pleasures of yours, you will all 
perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the children grew very grave, and they gazed one upon 
another, and all looked up into the face of the man, to see if he
spoke in earnest.&nbsp; They saw directly that he did, for that 
kind face looked full of care as well as of love: so from him 
they looked out upon the waves of the sea, and one whispered to 
another, &ldquo;Where shall we go? how shall we ever get over 
that sea? we can never swim across it: had we not better go back,
and play and be happy, until the time comes for us to 
die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man, looking round kindly upon them
all; &ldquo;you cannot swim over; you never could get over of 
yourselves: but you need not stay here and <!-- page 5--><a 
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>die; for I have
found a way of escape for you.&nbsp; Follow me, and you shall see
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I saw that he led them round a high rough rock, to where 
the calm waves of the sea ran up into a little bay, upon the 
white sand of which only a gentle ripple broke with a very 
pleasant sound.&nbsp; This bay was full of boats, small painted 
boats, with just room in each for one person, with a small rudder
to guide them at the stern, and a little sail as white as snow, 
and over all a flag, on which a bright red cross was flapping in 
the gentle sea-breeze.</p>
<p>Then when the children saw these beautiful boats, they clapped
their little hands together for very joy of heart.&nbsp; But the 
man spoke to them again and said, &ldquo;You will all have a 
deep, and dangerous, and stormy sea to pass over in these little 
boats.&nbsp; They will carry you quite safely, if you are careful
to do just as I bid you, for then neither are wind nor the <!-- 
page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>sea
can harm them; but they will bear you safely over the foaming 
waves to a bright and beautiful land&mdash;to a country where 
there is no burning mountain, and no angry lightning, and no bare
rocks, and no blasting hill-storm; but where there are trees 
bearing golden fruits by the side of beautiful rivers, into which
they sweep their green boughs.&nbsp; There the trees are always 
green, and the leaves ever fresh.&nbsp; There the fruit ripens 
every month, <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6" 
class="citation">[6]</a> and the very leaves upon the trees are 
healing.&nbsp; There is always glad and joyful light.&nbsp; There
are happy children who have passed this sea; and there are others
who have grown old full of happiness; there are some of your 
fathers, and mothers, and brothers, and sisters; and there am I 
ever present to keep and to comfort you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now when 
they heard this, all the children wished to jump into the boats, 
and he was kindly ready to help them, only he <!-- page 7--><a 
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>put each one in
carefully and slowly; and as he put him in, he gave him his 
charge.&nbsp; He told them that they must never look round to 
this island they were leaving, but must be always setting their 
faces towards the happy land they sought for.&nbsp; He told them 
that they must leave behind them all the shells and the berries 
which had pleased them here, for if they tried to take these with
them in their boats, some accident would certainly befall 
them.&nbsp; Then some of the children, when they heard all this, 
drew secretly away, and ran round the point, and gave up the 
boats and the sea, and began their old idle play again.&nbsp; And
some of them, I thought, hid the shells and the berries they had 
got, and then jumped into the boat, pretending they had left all 
behind them.</p>
<p>Then I saw that the man gave different presents to each of 
them, as they seated themselves in the boat.&nbsp; One was a 
little compass in a wooden box.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he <!--
page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>said, &ldquo;will always shew you which way to steer; you
are to follow me, for I shall always be before you on the waters;
but often when the darkness of the night comes on, or the thick 
mist seethes up from the wave&rsquo;s brim, or the calm has 
fallen upon you so that your boat has stood still,&mdash;often at
such times as these you may not be able even to mark my track 
before you: then you must look at the compass, and its finger 
will always point true and straight to where I am; and if you 
will follow me there, you will be safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave 
them, too, a musical instrument, which made a soft murmuring 
sound when they breathed earnestly into it; &ldquo;and 
this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must use when you are becalmed 
and so cannot get on, or when the waves swell into a storm around
you and threaten to swallow you up.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave them, 
too, bread and water for many days.</p>
<p>So I saw that they all set out upon <!-- page 9--><a 
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>their voyage, 
and a beautiful sight it was to look upon.&nbsp; Their snow-white
sails upon the deep sea shone like stars upon the blue of the 
firmament; and now they all followed close upon the 
leader&rsquo;s ship, and their little boats danced lightly and 
joyfully over the trackless waves, which lifted up their breasts 
to waft them over: and so they started.&nbsp; But I looked again 
in a little while, and they were beginning to be scattered very 
widely asunder: here and there three or four of the boats kept 
well together, and followed steadily in the track of the 
leader&rsquo;s vessel; then there was a long space of the sea 
with no boat upon it at all; then came a straggler or two, and 
then another company; and then, far off on the right and on the 
left, were other boats, which seemed to be wandering quite away 
from the leader&rsquo;s path.</p>
<p>Now, as I watched them closer, I saw that there were many 
different things which drew them away: one I saw, soon <!-- page 
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>after
they started, who turned back to look at the rocky island, 
forgetting the man&rsquo;s command.&nbsp; He saw the other 
children playing on the beach; he heard their merry voices; and 
then looking round again towards the sea, it looked rough and 
dark before him; and he forgot the burning mountain, and the 
terrible thunder, and the bright happy land for which he was 
bound, and the goodly company he was in, and the kind face of the
kingly man; and he was like one in a dream, before whose eyes all
sorts of shapes and colours fly, and in whose ears all sounds are
ringing; and he thought no more of the helm, nor watched the 
sails; and so the driving swell carried his boat idly along with 
its long roll; and in a few minutes more I saw it at the top of a
white foaming breaker, and then he and it were dashed down upon 
the rocks which girdled the sandy beach, and he was seen again no
more.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span>Then I turned my eyes to two other boats, which were 
going fast away from the true course, for no reason which I could
see; but when I looked at them more closely, I saw that they were
in a sort of angry race; each wished to get to the wind-side of 
the other; and they were so busy thinking about this, and looking
at one another with angry glances, and calling out to one another
with angry words, that they forgot to look for the leader&rsquo;s
ship, or to watch the finger of the compass; and so they were 
going altogether wide of the track along which they should have 
passed.</p>
<p>Then I looked closely at another, which was shooting quite 
away in another direction; and I saw that the poor child had left
the rudder, and was playing with something in the bottom of the 
boat; and as I looked nearer in it, I saw that it was with some 
of the bright berries of the rocky island which he had brought 
with him that he was so foolishly busy.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
12</span>Foolish, indeed, he was; and kind had been the warning 
of the man who bade them leave all these behind: for whilst I was
watching him, and wondering what would be the end of such a 
careless voyage, I saw his little boat strike suddenly upon a 
hidden rock, which broke a hole in its wooden sides, and the 
water rushed in, and the boat began to sink, and there was no 
help near, and the poor boy was soon drowned in the midst of the 
waves.</p>
<p>Then I turned sadly away to watch the boats which were 
following their leader; and here, too, I saw strange things; for 
though the sea when looked at from afar seemed just alike to all,
yet when I watched any one, I saw that he had some difficulties, 
and some frights, and some helps of his own, which I did not see 
the others have.</p>
<p>Sometimes it would fall all at once quite dark, like a thick 
night, all round a boat; and if he that was in it could hear the 
voice of a companion near him for a <!-- page 13--><a 
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>little while,
that gladdened him greatly; and then oftentimes all sound of 
voices died away, and all was dark, still, deep night, and he 
knew not where to steer.&nbsp; Now if, when this fell upon him, 
the child went straight to his compass, and looked close upon it,
in spite of the darkness, there came always a faint flashing 
light out of the darkness, which played just over the compass, so
as to shew him its straight blue finger, if he saw no more; and 
then, if he took up his musical instrument, and blew into it, 
though the thickness of the heavy air seemed at first to drown 
its sound, yet, after awhile, if he was but earnest, I could hear
its sweet murmuring sound begin; and then directly the child lost
his fears, and did not want company; sweet echoes of his music 
talked with his spirit out of the darkness, and within a little 
time the gloom would lift itself quite up again, or melt away 
into the softest light: and lo! he had got <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>on far on his
voyage even in this time of darkness, so that sometimes he could 
see the beloved form just before him; and at times even the 
wooded shore of the happy land would lift itself up, and shine on
his glad eyes, over the level brim of the silver sea.</p>
<p>From another boat it would seem that the very air of the 
heaven died away.&nbsp; There it lay, like a painted sail in a 
picture&mdash;the snow-white canvass drooping lazily, or flapping
to and fro, as the long dull swell heaved up the boat, and let it
sink again into the trough of the waves: other boats, but a 
little way off, would sail by with a full breeze; but he could 
not move; his very flag shewed no sign of life.&nbsp; Now if the 
little sailor began to amuse himself when this happened, it 
seemed to me that there he lay, and would lie, till the dark 
night overtook him, and parted him from all his company.&nbsp; 
But if, instead of this, he took up <!-- page 15--><a 
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>his musical 
instrument, and played upon it with all his earnestness, its soft
breath, as it whispered to the wind, soon woke up its gentle 
sighing; the long flag lifted itself on high; the blood-red cross
waved over the water; the snowy sails swelled out, and the little
boat danced on along its joyful way.</p>
<p>I noticed also that before those boats which were passing on 
the fastest, the sea would every now and then look very dark and 
threatening.&nbsp; Great waves would seem to lift their white 
heads just before them; whilst every where else the sea looked 
calm and enticing.&nbsp; Then the little sailor would strain his 
eye after his master&rsquo;s course, or look down at the faithful
compass; and by both of these sure signs he saw that his way lay 
straight through these threatening waves.&nbsp; Well was it for 
him, if, with a bold heart and a faithful hand, he steered right 
into them.&nbsp; For always did I see, that just as he got where 
<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>it seemed to be most dangerous, the tossing waves sank, 
as if to yield him an easy passage; the wind favoured him more 
than at any part of his voyage; and he got on in the right way 
faster than ever before.&nbsp; Especially was this so, if at 
first he was somewhat tossed, and yet held straight on; for then 
he shot into a glassy calm, where tide and wind bore him steadily
along unto the desired haven.&nbsp; But sad was it for him, if, 
instead of then trusting to the compass, he steered for the 
smoother water.&nbsp; One or two such trembling sailors I 
especially observed.&nbsp; One of them had long been sailing with
the foremost boats; he had met with less darkness, fewer mists or
troubled places, than the boats around him; and when he saw the 
white crests of the threatening waves lift up their strength 
before him, his heart began to sink; and after wavering for a 
moment, he turned his little boat aside to seek the calmer 
water.&nbsp; Through <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>it he seemed to be gliding on most 
happily, when all at once his little boat struck upon a hidden 
sandbank, and was fixed so firmly on its side, that it could not 
get afloat again.&nbsp; I saw not his end; but I sadly feared 
that when next the sea wrought with a troubled motion, and the 
surf broke upon that bank, his little boat must soon be shivered,
and he perish in the waves.</p>
<p>The other who turned aside followed closely after him; for 
this was one thing which I noted through all the voyage.&nbsp; 
Whenever one boat went astray, some thoughtless follower or other
would forget his compass, to sail after the unhappy wanderer; and
it often happened that these followers of others went the 
farthest wrong of any.&nbsp; So it was in this case; for when the
first boat struck upon the sandbank, the other, thinking to 
escape it, bore still farther off; and so chancing to pass just 
where the shoal ended, and an unruly <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>current swept
by its farthest edge, the boat was upset in a moment, and the 
poor child in it drowned.</p>
<p>And now I turned to three or four boats which had kept 
together from the time they left the harbour.&nbsp; Few were 
forwarder than they; few had smoother water or more prosperous 
gales.&nbsp; I could see, when I looked close into their faces, 
that they were all children of one family; and that all the 
voyage through they were helping, cheering, and directing one 
another.&nbsp; As I watched their ways, I noticed this, too, 
which seemed wonderful.&nbsp; If one of them had got into some 
trouble with its tackle, and the others stayed awhile to help it,
and to bring it on its way, instead of losing ground by this 
their kindness, they seemed all to make the greater progress, and
press on the further in their course.</p>
<p>And now I longed to see the ending of this voyage; and so 
looking on to those <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>which were most forward, I resolved 
to trace them to the end.</p>
<p>Then I found that all, without exception, came into a belt of 
storms and darkness before they reached the happy land.&nbsp; 
True, it was much rougher and more dark with some than others; 
but to every one there was a deep night and a troubled sea.&nbsp;
I saw, too, that when they reached this place, they were always 
parted one from another.&nbsp; Even those which had kept most 
close together all the voyage before, until just upon the edge of
this dark part, they, like the rest, were scattered here, and 
toiled on awhile singly and alone.</p>
<p>They seemed to me to fare the best who entered on it with the 
fullest sails, and had kept hitherto the straightest 
course.&nbsp; Indeed, as a common rule I found this always 
true&mdash;that those who had watched the compass, and held the 
rudder, and cheered themselves with the appointed music, and 
eaten the master&rsquo;s bread, and steered <!-- page 20--><a 
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>straight 
after him, they passed through this cloud and darkness easily and
swiftly.</p>
<p>Next to these were those who sought most earnestly to cheer 
its gloom with the sound of their appointed music.&nbsp; The Lord
of these seas, indeed, had many ways of cheering His 
followers.&nbsp; Even in the thickest of that darkness His face 
of beaming love would look out upon them; and He seemed nearer to
them then than He had done heretofore through all their 
voyage.</p>
<p>Then, moreover, it was never long; and bright light lay beyond
it.&nbsp; For they passed straight out of it into &ldquo;the 
haven where they would be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sweet sounds broke upon 
their glad ears even as they left that darkness.&nbsp; A great 
crowd of happy children&mdash;parents who had gone before 
them&mdash;friends whom they had loved, and holy persons whose 
names they had long known&mdash;these all lined the banks, 
waiting to receive and welcome them.&nbsp; <!-- page 21--><a 
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Amidst these 
moved up and down shining forms of beautiful beings, such as the 
children&rsquo;s eyes had seen only in some happy dream; and 
they, too, were their friends; they, too, waited for them on the 
bank; they, too, welcomed them with singing, and bore the happy 
new-comer with songs of triumph into the shining presence of the 
merciful King.&nbsp; Then, on the throne royal, and with the 
glorious crown upon His head, they saw the same kind face of 
gentle majesty which had looked upon them when they played on the
shores of that far rocky isle.&nbsp; They heard again the voice 
which had bid them fly the burning mountain.&nbsp; They saw Him 
who had taken them into His convoy; who had given them their 
boats; who had been near them in the storm; who had given them 
light in the darkness; who had helped them in the dull calm; who 
had never left them; but who had kept <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>and guided 
them across the ocean; and who now received them to His 
never-ending rest.</p>

27</span>The Vision of the Three States.</h2>
<p>I saw, in my vision, two glorious creatures walking together 
through a beautiful garden.&nbsp; I thought at first they must be
angels, so bright and happy did they seem.&nbsp; The garden, 
also, in which they were, seemed too beautiful for earth.&nbsp; 
Every flower which I had ever seen, and numbers which my eye had 
never looked upon, grew in abundance round them.&nbsp; They 
walked, as it were, upon a carpet of flowers.&nbsp; The breeze 
was quite full of the rich scent which arose from them.&nbsp; The
sun shone upon them with a brightness such as I had never seen 
before; whilst the air sparkled with myriads of winged <!-- page 
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>things, which flew here and there, as if to shew how 
happy they were.</p>
<p>All through the garden, too, I saw every sort of beast, in all
its natural grace and beauty; and all at peace.&nbsp; Great lions
moved about amongst tender sheep; and striped tigers lay down 
quietly to sleep amongst the dappled fawns which sported around 
them.&nbsp; But, amidst all these beautiful sights, my eyes 
followed more than all, the two glorious forms which were walking
together with such a kingly majesty through the happy garden: 
they were, truly, I could see, beings of this earth; they were 
talking to each other; they were speaking of <span 
class="smcap">One</span> who had made them out of the dust of the
earth; who had given to them living souls: who was their Father 
and their Friend; who had planted for them this beautiful garden,
and made them the rulers of all that was in it.</p>
<p>Now I marked them as they talked, <!-- page 29--><a 
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>and I could 
see that their eyes were often turned from all the beauty round 
them towards one far end of the garden; and as I watched them, I 
saw that they were still passing on towards it.&nbsp; Then I also
fixed my eyes there, and in a while I could see that, at the end 
of the garden to which they were moving, there was a bright 
light, brighter and purer than the light of the sun; and I 
thought that in it I could see here and there heavenly forms 
moving up and down, flying upon silver wings, or borne along upon
the light breath of the sunny air.&nbsp; But as I strained my 
eyes to pierce into it, it seemed to dazzle and confound them by 
its great lustre.&nbsp; Then, again, I heard the words of the 
two; and they spake of what was before them; of the bright light,
and the heavenly forms: and I found that they were only 
travellers through this beautiful garden; that the King who had 
placed them in it dwelt in that light, the brightness <!-- page 
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>of 
which had so confounded my gaze; that they were on their way to 
His presence, and that when they reached it, they should be happy
for ever; even as those shining spirits were already, whose 
golden figures I had been just able to discover.</p>
<p>Now, whilst I was pondering upon these things, and casting my 
eyes round and round this beautiful garden, I heard all at once a
most terrible sound, as of thunder, such as man&rsquo;s ears had 
never heard.&nbsp; I looked up, and the bright light at the end 
of the garden seemed to turn itself into angry fire, and to flash
red and threatening through thick black clouds, which were 
forming themselves into terrible shapes all over the 
garden.&nbsp; Then I looked for the two that I had seen before: I
could just see them; sorrow sat upon their faces, and fear made 
them deadly pale; a serpent was gliding from them into the 
bushes; and their eyes were fixed upon <!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the air, as 
though voices, which I heard not, were speaking terrible things 
to their inner ears.&nbsp; Then, as I looked, it grew darker and 
darker&mdash;the thunder pealed all round me&mdash;cries came 
forth from every hill, as of fierce and deadly beasts in wild 
dreadful fight.&nbsp; The flowers round me were withering up, as 
if a burning blight had passed over them; and soon it was all 
dark, and dreary, and desolate.</p>
<p>Then when my heart was very heavy within me, methought there 
stood by me one of the forms of light whom I had seen at the 
garden&rsquo;s end; and my knees smote together through fear of 
his glory; but he looked upon me kindly, and spoke to me in a 
voice of pity, and he said, &ldquo;Wouldst thou see the end of 
this sight?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then my heart gathered courage, and I 
told him, that if it were lawful, I would indeed fain look upon 
it.</p>
<p>With that he lifted me, and we flew through the air, and I 
knew not where <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>he had borne me; but in a while he 
set me on my feet, and bade me look right down beneath me.&nbsp; 
Then I looked down at his word, but could see nothing.&nbsp; My 
eyes seemed to rest upon the thick mantle of the night, and they 
could not pierce through it.&nbsp; Now, while I was striving to 
pierce through the darkness, strange noises rose from it to my 
ears.&nbsp; All sounds that ever were, came up from it, so 
mingled together that I could not say what they were.&nbsp; 
Whether it were a groan, or a cry, or a roaring, or music, or 
shouting, or the voice of anger or of sorrow; for all of these 
seemed joined together into one; but the groaning was louder than
the laughing, and the voice of crying well nigh drowned the 
music.&nbsp; Then I asked my guide what was this strange noise; 
and he told me that it was the voice of all <span 
class="smcap">the world</span>, as it rose up to the ears of 
those that were on high.&nbsp; Then I begged of him, if it might 
be, to let me see those <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>from whom it came.&nbsp; With that he
touched my eyes; and now methought, though the darkness remained,
that I could see in the midst of its thickness, even as in the 
brightness of the day.</p>
<p>It was a strange place into which I looked.&nbsp; Instead of 
the beautiful garden I had seen before, and two glorious 
creatures passing through it; now I saw a multitude of men, 
women, and children, passing on through a waste and desolate 
wilderness.&nbsp; Here and there, indeed, there were still 
flowery spots, but they were soon trodden down by the feet of 
those who passed along.&nbsp; Strange too were their steps.&nbsp;
Now, instead of passing straight on, they moved round and round, 
for they were all in the black darkness.&nbsp; The ground was 
full of pitfalls, in the low bottoms of which I could see red 
fire burning fierce and hot, and one after another fell over into
these pitfalls, and I saw them no more.&nbsp; Evil beasts, too, 
<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>moved amongst them, slaying one, and tearing another; 
and as if this was not enough, oftentimes they would quarrel and 
fight with one another, until the ground all around was covered 
with their bodies strewed upon it.</p>
<p>Yet for all this, some would sing, and dance, and frolic; and 
this seemed to me the saddest of all, for they were like mad men;
and mad in truth they were, for in the midst of their dancing and
their singing, one and another would get near the side of some 
great pitfall, and step over into its flames, even with the song 
upon their lips.</p>
<p>In vain did I strain my eyes to see any light at the end, as I
had seen it in the garden.&nbsp; If it was there, the black 
clouds had rolled over it so thick and dark that not a ray of it 
was left.</p>
<p>Yet I heard one and another offering to lead those that would 
follow them, safely through this terrible wilderness; and such 
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
35</span>men never wanted followers: so I watched many of these 
leaders, to see what they would do for those that trusted 
them.&nbsp; Little help could any of them render.&nbsp; Some put 
their followers on a path which led straight down into the 
deepest and most frightful pitfalls; some set them on a path 
which wandered round and round, and brought them at the end back 
to the same place from which they started; some led them into 
thorny places, where the poor pilgrims pierced their bleeding 
feet with many a wound: but not one did I see who brought them 
into any better place, or took them any nearer to their 
journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>How they found their way at all, was at first my wonder.&nbsp;
But as I looked more closely, I saw in all their hands little 
lanterns, which just threw a feeble light upon the darkness round
them.&nbsp; These were always brightest in the young, for they 
soon grew very dim; and the <!-- page 36--><a 
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>falls and 
blows they met with, bruised and shattered them so much, that 
some had hardly any glimmering left, even of the feeble light 
which they had seemed to cast of old.</p>
<p>I looked at them until my heart was very sad, for there was no
peace, no safety, no hope; but all went heavily and sadly, 
groaning and weeping, or laughing like madmen, until, sooner or 
later, they seemed all to perish in the fearful pitfalls!</p>
<p>Then my angel-guide spoke to me again, marking my sadness, and
he said, &ldquo;Hast thou well observed this sight?&rdquo; and I 
answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he said, &ldquo;And 
wouldst thou see more?&rdquo;&nbsp; So when I had said 
&ldquo;yes,&rdquo; methought we were once more flying through the
air, until again he set me on my feet, and bid me look 
down.&nbsp; Now here, too, strange noises reached my ears; but as
I listened to them, I found that there were mixed with them such 
sounds as I had not heard before.&nbsp; <!-- page 37--><a 
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Sweet clear 
voices came up now from the din, speaking, as it were from one 
close by me, words of faith, and of hope, and of love; and they 
sounded to me like the happy talking which I had heard at the 
first between the glorious beings in the garden.</p>
<p>So when my guide touched my eyes, I bent them eagerly down 
into the darkness below me.</p>
<p>At first I thought that it was the same place I had seen last,
for there was a busy multitude passing to and fro; and there was 
music and dancing, and sobbing and crying; there were pitfalls, 
too, and wild beasts.&nbsp; But as I looked closer, I saw that, 
in spite of all this, it was not the place that I had seen 
before.&nbsp; Even at a glance I could see that there were many 
more flowers here than there; and that many amongst the pilgrims 
were going straight on, with happy faces, by a road which passed 
safely by all the pitfalls.&nbsp; I could <!-- page 38--><a 
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>see, too, 
that at the end of the road was a dim shining of that happy light
which had been so bright in the beautiful garden.</p>
<p>Now, as I looked, I saw that there were but a few who kept to 
this straight safe road, and that many were scattered all over 
the plain.&nbsp; I saw many leave this path even as I looked upon
it; and very few did I see come back to it: those who did, seemed
to me to find it very hard to get into it again; whether it was 
that its sides were slippery, or its banks so steep, many fainted
and gave up, after trying to climb into it again.&nbsp; But it 
seemed quite easy to leave it; for every one who left it went on 
at first lightly and pleasantly.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, they 
seemed greatly startled after taking their first step out of it, 
and some of them turned straight back, and after a few struggles,
more or less, such always got into it again.&nbsp; But if once 
after this first check they set out for the plain, they <!-- page
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>seemed to go easily along, until their path lay straight
by the den of some destroying beast, or led them into the midst 
of the pitfalls, where they wholly lost their reckoning, and knew
not how to get on, or how to get back.</p>
<p>I saw, too, after a while, that they had got lanterns in their
hands, some of which gave a great deal of light.&nbsp; Those 
which were carried along the narrow path shot out bright rays on 
all sides, until towards the end they quite blazed with 
light.&nbsp; I could see, too, that these travellers had some way
of trimming and dressing their lamps; and that much of their 
light seemed to come from an open book which they carried in 
their hands, from the leaves of which there flashed out 
continually streams of light, which made their lamps burn so 
brightly that all their road shone with it.&nbsp; But as they got
further and further from the path, their lamps began to burn 
dim.&nbsp; All these travellers, <!-- page 40--><a 
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>too, had the 
book of light closed; or if they now and then opened it, they 
shut it up again, some carelessly, and some as if its light 
frightened them; and not one could I see who stopped to trim his 
light: so that just when they got amongst the pitfalls, and 
wanted light the most, they were all the most nearly in 
darkness.</p>
<p>Now, when I had looked at them for a space, and wondered, my 
guide said to me, &ldquo;Wouldst thou see how they enter on this 
plain?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he took me to a fair porch, which came 
from the wilderness I had looked upon before; and there I saw a 
man standing in white robes, and speaking good words, and giving 
good gifts to each one as he came in.&nbsp; There were persons 
coming in of all nations and people, and some, too, of all ages, 
though the greatest number were little children, so small that 
their little hands would not hold the man&rsquo;s gifts, and so 
he hung them <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>round their necks, for them to use as
soon as they were able.</p>
<p>Then I joined myself to the group, to hear and see the better 
what was passing.&nbsp; The man in white was speaking with a 
grave kind voice as I came up.&nbsp; He told the pilgrims that 
the great Lord of the land had built that porch, and set him 
there to help the poor travellers, who were before without hope 
or help amongst the beasts, and snares, and pitfalls of the 
terrible wilderness; he told them that the blood of the 
King&rsquo;s own Son had been shed, that that porch might be 
built; that the King had prepared them a narrow way to walk in, 
which led straight from that porch to His own blessed presence, 
and that they might all pass along it safely if they would; he 
told them that if they left that path, they would surely get 
again amongst the pitfalls which they had left in the wilderness;
nay, that they would be worse off than they had been <!-- page 
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>even 
there, for that there was no other porch where they could again 
be set right, and no other place where the gifts that he was 
giving them now, could ever be got any more, if they were once 
thrown quite away.</p>
<p>Then I looked to see what these gifts were.&nbsp; I saw the 
man bring forth clear and sparkling water, which shone as if with
living light; and with this he washed from them the dirt and the 
bruises of the terrible wilderness: with this, too, he touched 
their little lamps, and as it touched them, they grew so bright 
and clear, that the light within poured freely forth on all 
around them.&nbsp; Then he looked in their faces, and gave them a
name, which he wrote down in the King&rsquo;s book; and he told 
them, that by this name they should be known, not only by their 
fellow-travellers, but that this would remain written in the 
King&rsquo;s book here, unless they wholly left His path; and 
that every name <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>which remained written here, they 
would find written in another book in letters of gold and of 
fire, when they reached the other end of the path; and that for 
every pilgrim, whose name was written there, the golden gate 
would open of itself, and he would find a place and a crown in 
the presence of the King.</p>
<p>Then, as he spoke all these glorious words, my heart burned 
within me to see how the travellers sped.</p>
<p>But he had not yet done with them; for he brought out of his 
stores a golden vial for each one; and he told them that in it 
the King had stored the oil of light and beauty for the dressing 
of their lamps.</p>
<p>Then he shewed them how to use it: not carelessly or lightly, 
for then the oil would not flow; but earnestly, and with great 
care; and then sweet odours issued from the vial, and the flame 
of the lamp burned brightly and high.&nbsp; He gave them, too, 
the precious light-book, <!-- page 44--><a 
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>which I had 
seen; and he bade them read in it when it was dark, or the way 
was slippery; and that they should ever find that it was a 
&ldquo;lantern unto their feet, and a light unto their 
paths.&rdquo;&nbsp; He put, too, into the hand of each a trusty 
staff, suited to their age; and then he told them, while they 
leant upon it, it would bear them up at many a pinch, and ever 
grow with their growth, and strengthen with their strength.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Church-truth&rdquo; he called these staffs; and they were 
made after a marvellous fashion, for they were as if many wands 
had been woven together to make one; and as I looked, I could see
&ldquo;example,&rdquo; and &ldquo;experience,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;discipline,&rdquo; and &ldquo;creeds,&rdquo; written upon 
some of these wands, which grew together into 
&ldquo;Church-truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I longed greatly to follow forth some of these whom I had
seen under the porch; and as I gazed, I saw the man look 
earnestly into the face of a fair <!-- page 45--><a 
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>boy, who 
stood before him: he gave him the name of &ldquo;Gottlieb,&rdquo;
<a name="citation45a"></a><a href="#footnote45a" 
class="citation">[45a]</a> and entered it in the book, and put 
the staff in his hand, and washed him with living water, and hung
the vial at his side, and put the banded staff into his hands; 
and, bidding him God-speed, set him out upon his journey.</p>
<p>Then he looked steadily into the face of another, and it, too,
was fair to look upon; but it had not the quiet happy peace of 
the last.&nbsp; The man wrote it down as &ldquo;Irrgeist;&rdquo; 
<a name="citation45b"></a><a href="#footnote45b" 
class="citation">[45b]</a> and I thought a shade of sadness swept
over his brow as he gave to him the King&rsquo;s goodly 
gifts.</p>
<p>Then he sent forth a third, whose timid eye seemed hardly firm
enough for so long a journey; and I heard the name that was given
him, and it was &ldquo;Furchtsam.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation45c"></a><a href="#footnote45c" 
class="citation">[45c]</a>&nbsp; Close to him went another, with 
a firm step, and an eye of steady gentleness; <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>and I saw, by
the King&rsquo;s book, that he bore the name of 
&ldquo;Gehulf&egrave;.&rdquo; <a name="citation46"></a><a 
href="#footnote46" class="citation">[46]</a></p>
<p>So these four set out upon their journey; and I followed them 
to see how they should fare.&nbsp; Now, I saw that at first, when
they started, they were so small that they could not read in the 
goodly book, neither could they use the golden vials; and their 
little banded sticks would have fallen from their hands, if they 
had not been small and thin, like the first green shoots of the 
spring.&nbsp; Their lamps, too, cast no light outwardly, yet 
still they made some way upon the path; and whilst I wondered how
this might be, I saw that a loving hand was stretched out of the 
darkness round them, which held them up and guided them on their 
way.</p>
<p>But, anon, in a while they were grown larger; and I could see 
Gottlieb walking on the first, and his book of light was <!-- 
page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
47</span>open in his hand, and his lamp burned bright, for he 
often refreshed it with oil, and he leant upon his good staff, 
and strode along the road.</p>
<p>Then, as he walked on, I saw that there stood upon his path a 
shadowy figure, as of one in flowing robes, and on her head she 
seemed to wear a chaplet of many flowers; in her hands was a cup 
of what seemed to be crystal water, and a basket of what looked 
like cool and refreshing fruit.&nbsp; A beautiful light played 
all round her, and half shewed her and her gifts to the 
boy.&nbsp; She bid him welcome, as he came up to her; so he 
raised his eyes from his book, and looked to see who spoke to 
him.&nbsp; Then she spoke kindly to him; and she held forth the 
cup towards him, and asked him if he would not drink.&nbsp; Now, 
the boy was hot with walking, for the air was close, so he 
stretched out his hand to take the cup; but though it seemed so 
near to him, he could not <!-- page 48--><a 
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>reach 
it.&nbsp; And at the same moment she spake to him again, and 
asked him to come where these fruits grew, and where the breeze 
whispered amongst the boughs of yonder trees,&mdash;and there to 
drink and rest, and then go on his way again.&nbsp; Then I saw 
that she had power to call out of the darkness the likeness of 
all she spoke of.&nbsp; So he looked at the trees to which she 
pointed; and the sun seemed to shine around them, and the shade 
looked cool and tempting under them, and the pleasant breeze 
rustled amongst their fresh leaves; and he thought the road upon 
which he was travelling was hotter and darker, and more tiring 
than ever; and he put up his hand to his burning brow, and she 
said to him, as he lingered, &ldquo;come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, the 
trees to which she pointed him lay off his road, or he would 
gladly have rested under them; and whilst he doubted what to do, 
he looked down to the book that was open in his hand; <!-- page 
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>and 
the light shot out upon it bright and clear, and the words which 
he read were these, &ldquo;None that go unto her return again, 
neither take they hold of the paths of life.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a" 
class="citation">[49a]</a>&nbsp; And as he read it, he looked 
again at the stranger; and now he could see more clearly through 
the wild light which played around her, and he knew that it was 
the evil enemy who stood before him; the sparkling cup, too, and 
the fruit, turned into bitter ashes; and the pleasant shady grass
became a thorny and a troublesome brake: so, pushing by her with 
the help of his staff, he began to mend his pace; and looking 
down into the book of light, there shone out, as in letters of 
fire, &ldquo;Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by 
taking heed thereto according to Thy word.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b" 
class="citation">[49b]</a></p>
<p>Then I saw that he was feeding his lamp, which had begun to 
grow dim as <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>he parleyed with the tempter, and 
that he ceased not till it streamed out as bright and as clear as
ever.</p>
<p>But still the air was hot and sultry, and no cool breath blew 
upon him; and if he looked off for a moment from his book, the 
fair form of the tempter stood again beside him in silver light; 
the cold water sparkled close to his lips; and trees with shady 
boughs waving backward and forward over fresh green grass, and 
full, in every spray, of singing-birds, seemed to spring up 
around him.&nbsp; For a little moment his step faltered; but as 
his lamp streamed out its light, all the vain shadows passed 
away: and I heard him say, as he struck his staff upon the 
ground, &ldquo;I have made a covenant with my eyes;&rdquo; and 
even as she heard it, the tempter passed away, and left him to 
himself.&nbsp; Scarcely was she gone, before he passed by the 
door of a beautiful arbour.&nbsp; It was strewn with the softest 
moss; roses <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>and honeysuckle hung down over its 
porch; light, as from a living diamond, gleamed from its roof; 
and in the midst of its floor, a clear, cool, sparkling stream of
the purest water bubbled ever up from the deep fountain below 
it.&nbsp; Now, as this lay on the road, Gottlieb halted for a 
moment to look at it; and the light of his lamp waxed not dim, 
though he thus stayed to see it; the book of fire, too, spoke to 
him of rest, and of halting by &ldquo;palm-trees and wells of 
water;&rdquo; and as he looked, he read in letters of light over 
the door-way&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Faithful pilgrim, banish fear,<br />
Thou mayst enter safely here:<br />
Rest for thee thy Lord did win;<br />
Faithful pilgrim, enter in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Gottlieb rejoiced greatly, and cast himself gladly upon 
the mossy floor, and bent down his parched lips to drink of the 
cool spring which bubbled up before him.</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>Now, whilst he was resting safely here, I turned to see 
how it fared with the others who had set out with him from the 
porch, for they had not got as far as Gottlieb.</p>
<p>The first of them was Irrgeist; and when I looked upon him, he
was drawing near to the place where Gottlieb had fallen in with 
the tempter.&nbsp; Irrgeist was walking quickly on&mdash;so 
quickly that, at the first glance, I thought he would soon be by 
the side of Gottlieb.&nbsp; But, upon looking more closely, I saw
that Gottlieb&rsquo;s steps had been far more steady and even 
than those with which Irrgeist was pressing on; for 
Irrgeist&rsquo;s lamp burned but dimly, and gave him no sure 
light to walk in.&nbsp; Very near to the place where Gottlieb had
met with her, the tempter stood beside Irrgeist.&nbsp; He was not
looking at his book, as the other had been; and he did not wait 
to be spoken to; for as soon as he saw the light which played 
round her figure, he began <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>to speak to 
her, and asked who she was.&nbsp; She told him that her name was 
&ldquo;Pleasure;&rdquo; and forthwith she shewed to him her 
crystal cup and fruits; and she brought before the charmed eyes 
of the wanderer all the gay show with which she had tried before 
to mislead the faithful Gottlieb.&nbsp; There was the bright 
sunshine, and the green path, and the waving trees, and the 
rustling of the wind, and the song of birds, and the sweet 
resting-shade.&nbsp; Irrgeist looked eagerly at all she shewed 
him, and in his haste to reach out his hand for the cup, he 
dropped altogether the trusty staff of 
&ldquo;Church-truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the cup seemed to draw 
away from him, just as it had done from Gottlieb; but he followed
thoughtlessly after it.&nbsp; And soon I saw that he left the 
path upon which he had been set; and though he started suddenly 
as soon as he was off it, yet it was but a moment&rsquo;s 
start,&mdash;the cup was close before him, the shadowy form led 
him on, the <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>grass was green, and the trees and 
the sunlight but a little farther.</p>
<p>And now I saw him drink some of the enchanted water; and as he
drank it, his look grew wild, and his cheek burnt like the cheek 
of one in a fever; and he walked after the deceitful figure with 
a quicker step than ever: but I saw that his lamp was almost out,
that the book of living light had fallen from his hands, and the 
golden vial hung down, ready, as it seemed, to fall from him 
altogether.</p>
<p>Still he walked on; and a strange flitting light, from the 
form which was before him, lightened the darkness of the valley, 
so that he could pass on quickly; the meadow, also, was smooth 
and even, and there was a rustling breeze, which played around 
him: so that he got on faster than he had ever done upon the 
narrow path, and thought that he was getting well on to his 
journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Many times did he put forth his hand 
for the <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>sparkling cup, and drank of it again 
and again.</p>
<p>But now I saw, as I thought, a strange change which was coming
over him; for he drank oftener of the bowl, but appeared each 
time to find it less refreshing.&nbsp; Sometimes it seemed almost
bitter, and yet he could not but take it the very moment he had 
thrust it from him.&nbsp; The shadowy form, also, before him 
seemed altogether altering; he looked again, and her beautiful 
features and pleasant countenance had changed into a sharp, 
stern, and reproachful frown.&nbsp; His own voice, which had been
heretofore almost like one singing, grew sad and angry.&nbsp; The
very figure of his guide seemed vanishing from his eyes; the 
light which floated round her grew wilder and more uncertain, and
his own lamp was almost out.&nbsp; He felt puzzled and 
bewildered, and hardly knew which way to go: he had got into a 
broad beaten path, and he found that many <!-- page 56--><a 
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>besides 
himself were going here and there along it.&nbsp; Sometimes they 
sang; and, in very bitterness of heart, he tried to sing too, 
that he might not think: but every now and then, when a flashing 
light came, and he saw the look of the travellers amongst whom he
was, it made his very heart shiver&mdash;they looked so sad and 
so wretched.&nbsp; Now, none went straight on: some turned into 
this path, some into that; and then he soon lost sight of them 
altogether.&nbsp; Sometimes he heard fearful cries, as if wild 
beasts had seized them; sometimes a dreadful burst of flame from 
the horrid pits which I had seen, made him fear that they had 
fallen over into them: for poor Irrgeist had got now into the 
midst of the deep pits and the ravenous beasts.&nbsp; And soon he
found how terrible was his danger.&nbsp; He had been following 
one who had made him believe that he had light to guide his 
steps; he had gone with him out of the beaten path; and they were
<!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
57</span>pressing on together, when Irrgeist suddenly lost sight 
of him in the darkness; and whether it was that he had fallen 
into a pit, or become the prey of some evil beast, Irrgeist knew 
not; only, he found that he was more alone than ever, and near to
some great peril.&nbsp; Poor Irrgeist sprang aside with all his 
force, thinking only of the danger which he feared; but, feeling 
his feet slipping under him, he turned, and saw that he had got 
upon the treacherous brink of a fearful pit; down which, at the 
very moment, another pilgrim fell.&nbsp; The fierce red flames 
rose out of it with a roar like thunder, and a blaze like the 
mouth of a furnace; and the wind blew the flames into the face of
Irrgeist, so that he was singed and almost blinded.&nbsp; Then 
the poor boy called in the bitterness of his heart upon Pleasure,
who had led him out of the way, and now had forsaken him; but she
came no more&mdash;only terrible thoughts troubled him; and <!-- 
page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
58</span>he heard the hissing of serpents as they slid along in 
the bushes near him, and all evil noises sounded in his ears, 
till he scarcely knew where he was standing.&nbsp; Then he 
thought of his staff, which he had dropped when Pleasure had 
first tempted him, and he grieved that it was gone; and he felt 
in the folds of his mantle, hoping that he might still have the 
book of light within it; for he had too often thrust it there at 
the beginning of his journey; but he could not find it.&nbsp; 
Then he strove to get some light from his little lamp; for, hurt 
as it was, he had it still in his hand, and he thought there was 
just a little blue light playing most faintly within it; but this
was not enough to direct him on his way, rather did it make his 
way more dark.&nbsp; Then at last he bethought him of the golden 
vial.&nbsp; Few were there of those near him but had lost theirs 
altogether, and his hung only by a single thread.&nbsp; But it 
was not gone; and <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>when he had striven long, he just 
drew from it a single drop of oil, and he trimmed his lamp, and 
it yielded forth a little trembling light, just enough to shew 
that it was not altogether dead.&nbsp; With the help of this 
light he saw that when he had dropped his book of fire, one 
single leaf had been torn from it, and stuck to his mantle; so he
seized it eagerly, and strove to draw light from it; but all that
it would yield was red and angry-looking light, and all that he 
could read was, &ldquo;the way of transgressors is 
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Irrgeist! he sat down almost in despair, and wept as if 
his heart would break.&nbsp; &ldquo;O, that I had never trusted 
Pleasure;&rdquo; &ldquo;O, that I had never left the path;&rdquo;
&ldquo;O, that I had my book of light, and my lamp&rsquo;s former
brightness, and my goodly stick;&rdquo; &ldquo;O, that one would 
lighten my darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then did it seem to me as if in the murmur of the air around 
him two voices were speaking to the boy.&nbsp; One was like <!-- 
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>the gentle voice of the man whom I had seen at the porch
of the valley; and it seemed to whisper, &ldquo;return,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;return;&rdquo; &ldquo;mercy,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;forgiveness.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he listened, something 
like hope mixed with the bitter tears which ran down the face of 
the wanderer.&nbsp; But then would sound the other voice, harsh, 
and loud, and threatening; and it said, &ldquo;too late,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;too late,&rdquo; &ldquo;despair,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the poor boy was sadly torn and scattered in his thoughts 
by these two different voices; but methought, as he guarded his 
golden vial, and strove to trim his dying lamp, that the gentle 
voice became more constant, and the voice of terror more dull and
distant.</p>
<p>Then, as I was watching him, all at once the boy sprang up, 
and he seemed to see a light before him, so straight on did he 
walk: many crossed his path and jostled against him, but he cared
not; he heard the sweet voice plainer and plainer, like the soft 
murmuring of the cushat <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>dove in the early summer, and he 
would follow where it led.&nbsp; Hitherto his pathway had been 
smooth, and he had hastened along it; but this did not last, for 
now it narrowed almost to a line, and ran straight between two 
horrible pitfalls; so he paused for a moment; but the roaring of 
a lion was behind him, and forward he pressed.&nbsp; It was a 
sore passage for Irrgeist, for the whole ground was strewed with 
thorns, which pierced his feet at every step, and the sparks from
the fire-pits flew ever round him, and now and then fell in 
showers over him.&nbsp; Neither did he hear now the pleasant 
sound of the voice of kindness; whether it were that it had died 
away, he knew not, or whether it were that the crackling and 
roaring of the fierce flames, and the voice of the beasts behind,
and his own groans and crying, drowned its soft music, so that he
heard it not.</p>
<p>I had looked at him until I could bear <!-- page 62--><a 
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>it no more; 
for the path seemed to grow narrower and narrower; the flames 
from the two pits already almost touched; and I could not endure 
to see, as I feared I should, the little one, whom I had watched,
become the prey of their devouring fierceness.&nbsp; So, with a 
bitter groan for Irrgeist, I turned me back to the road to see 
how it fared with Furchtsam and Gehulf&egrave;.</p>
<p>They had fallen far behind the others from the first.&nbsp; 
Poor little Furchtsam had a trembling tottering gait; and as he 
walked, he looked on this side and on that, as if every step was 
dangerous.&nbsp; This led him often to look off his book of 
light, and then it would shut up its leaves, and then his little 
lamp grew dimmer and dimmer, and his feet stumbled, and he 
trembled so, that he almost dropped his staff out of his 
hands.&nbsp; Yet still he kept the right path, only he got along 
it very slowly and with pain.</p>
<p>Whether it was that Gehulf&egrave; was too <!-- page 63--><a 
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>tender 
spirited to leave him, or why else, I know not, but he kept close
by the little trembler, and seemed ever waiting to help 
him.&nbsp; Many a time did he catch him by the hand when he was 
ready to fall, and speak to him a word of comfort, when without 
it he would have sunk down through fear.&nbsp; So they got on 
together, and now they came to the part of the pathway which the 
evil enchantress haunted.&nbsp; She used all her skill upon them,
and brought up before their eyes all the visions she could raise;
sunshine, and singing-birds, and waving boughs, and green grass, 
and sparkling water, they all passed before their eyes,&mdash;but
they heeded them not: once, indeed, poor Furchtsam for a moment 
looked with a longing eye at the painted sunshine, as if its warm
light would have driven off some of his fears; but it was but for
a moment.&nbsp; And as for Gehulf&egrave;, whether it was that he
was reading his book of light too closely, or trimming <!-- page 
64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>too 
carefully his lamp, or helping too constantly his trembling 
friend, for some cause or other he scarcely seemed to see the 
visions which the sorceress had spread around him.&nbsp; So when 
she had tried all her skill for a season, and found it in vain, 
she vanished altogether from them, and they saw her no 
more.&nbsp; But their dangers were not over yet.&nbsp; When 
Gottlieb passed along this road, he had gone on so boldly, that I
had not noticed how fearful it was in parts to any giddy head or 
fainting heart.&nbsp; But now I saw well how it terrified 
Furchtsam.&nbsp; For here it seemed to rise straight up to a 
dangerous height, and to become so narrow at the same time, and 
to be so bare of any side-wall or parapet, that it was indeed a 
giddy thing to pass along it.&nbsp; Yet when one walked over it, 
as Gottlieb did, leaning on his staff of Church-truth, reading 
diligently in his book, and trimming ever and anon his lamp, such
a light fell upon <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the narrow path, and the darkness so 
veiled the precipice, that the pilgrim did not know that there 
was any thing to fear.&nbsp; But not so when you stopped to 
look&mdash;then it became terrible indeed; you soon lost all 
sight of the path before you; for the brightest lamp only lighted
the road just by your feet, and that seemed rising almost to an 
edge, whilst the flash of distant lights here and there shewed 
that a fearful precipice was on each side.</p>
<p>Furchtsam trembled exceedingly when he looked at it; and even 
Gehulf&egrave;, when, instead of marching on, he stopped to talk 
about it, began to be troubled with fears.&nbsp; Now, as they 
looked here and there, Furchtsam saw an easy safe-looking path, 
which promised to lead them in the same direction, but along the 
bottom of the cliffs.&nbsp; Right glad was he to see it; and so 
taking the lead for once, he let fall his staff, that by catching
hold of the bushes on the bank, he might drop down <!-- page 
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>more 
easily upon the lower path; and there he got with very little 
trouble.</p>
<p>It was all done in a moment; and when he was out of the path, 
Gehulf&egrave; turned round and saw where he was gone.&nbsp; Then
he tried to follow after him; but he could not draw his staff 
with him through the gap, or climb down the bank without letting 
it go.&nbsp; And, happily for him, he held it so firmly, that 
after one or two trials he stopped.&nbsp; Then, indeed, was he 
glad, as soon as he had time to think; and he held his good stick
firmer in his hand than ever, for now he saw plainly that 
Furchtsam was quite out of the road, and that he had himself 
well-nigh followed him.&nbsp; So leaning over the side, he began 
to call to his poor timid companion, and encourage him to mount 
up again, by the bank which he had slipped down, and venture 
along the right way with him.&nbsp; At first Furchtsam shook his 
head mournfully, and would not hear of it.&nbsp; But when <!-- 
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
67</span>Gehulf&egrave; reminded him that they had a true promise
from the King, that nothing should harm them whilst they kept to 
the high way of holiness, and that the way upon which he had now 
entered was full of pitfalls, and wild beasts, and every sort of 
danger, and that in it he must be alone,&mdash;then his reason 
began to come back to him, and Furchtsam saw into what an evil 
state he had brought himself; and with all his heart he wished 
himself back again by the side of Gehulf&egrave;.&nbsp; But it 
was no such easy matter to get back.&nbsp; His lamp was so 
bruised and shaken as he slid down, that it threw scarcely any 
light at all; while it had never seemed, he thought, so dark as 
it did now: he could not see the bushes to which he had clung 
just before, or the half path which had brought him down.&nbsp; 
Gehulf&egrave;&rsquo;s voice from above was some guide to him, 
and shewed him in which direction to turn; but when he tried to 
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>mount the bank, it was so steep and so slippery, he 
could scarcely cling to it; and he had no staff to lean upon, and
no friendly hand to help him.&nbsp; Surely if it had not been for
the kind encouraging voice of Gehulf&egrave;, the weak and 
trembling heart of Furchtsam would have failed utterly, and he 
would have given up altogether.</p>
<p>Now, just at this time, whilst he was reaching out to 
Furchtsam, and urging him to strive more earnestly, he heard a 
noise as of one running upon the path behind him; and he looked 
round and saw one of the King&rsquo;s own messengers coming fast 
upon it: so when he came up to Gehulf&egrave;, he stopped and 
asked him what made him tarry thus upon the King&rsquo;s 
path.&nbsp; Then Gehulf&egrave; answered very humbly, that he was
striving to help back poor Furchtsam into the right way, from 
which he had been driven by his fears.&nbsp; Then the messenger 
of the King looked <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>upon him kindly, and bid him 
&ldquo;fear not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rightly,&rdquo; he said, 
&ldquo;art thou named Gehulf&egrave;, for thou hast been ready to
help the weak; and the Lord, who has bidden his children 
&lsquo;to bear one another&rsquo;s burdens,&rsquo; has watched 
thee all alone thy way, and looked upon thee with an eye of love;
and forasmuch as thou seemest to have been hindered in thy own 
course by helping thy brother, the King has sent me to carry thee
on up this steep place, and over this dangerous 
road.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that, I saw that he lifted up the boy, 
and was about to fly with him through the air.&nbsp; Then, seeing
that he cast a longing look towards the steep bank, down which 
Furchtsam had slipped, and that the sound of his sad voice was 
still ringing in his ear; the King&rsquo;s messenger said to him,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cast thy burden upon the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;The Lord careth for thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;For the very
hairs of your head are numbered,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the Lord is 
full of <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>compassion, pitiful, and of great 
mercy.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; So the heart of Gehulf&egrave; was 
soothed, and with a happy mind he gave himself to the messenger, 
and he bore him speedily along the dangerous path, as if his feet
never touched the ground, but refreshing airs breathed upon his 
forehead as he swept along, and silver voices chanted holy words 
to his glad heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;He shall gather the lambs in his 
arms,&rdquo; said one; and another and a sweeter took up the 
strain and sang, &ldquo;and he shall carry them in his 
bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he passed along the way swiftly and 
most happily.</p>
<p>Then I saw that he bore him to the mouth of the arbour into 
which Gottlieb had turned to rest.&nbsp; And now as he came up to
it, Gottlieb was just coming forth again to renew his 
journey.&nbsp; Right glad was Gottlieb of the company of such a 
comrade; so they joined their hands together, and walked along 
the road speaking to one another of the kindness of the <!-- page
71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>King,
and telling one to the other all that had befallen them 
hitherto.&nbsp; A pleasant thing it was to see them marching 
along that road, their good staffs in their hands, their lamps 
burning brightly, and their books sending forth streams of light,
to shew them the way that they should go.&nbsp; But now I saw 
they got into a part of the road which was rough and full of 
stones; and unless they kept the lights they bore with them ever 
turned towards the road, and looked, too, most carefully to their
footing, they were in constant danger of falling.&nbsp; The air, 
also, seemed to have some power here of sending them to sleep, 
for I saw that Gottlieb&rsquo;s steps were not as steady and 
active as they had been; and he looked often from this side to 
that, to see if there were any other resting-place provided for 
him; but none could he see: and then methought, as he walked on, 
his eyes would close as he bent them down over his book, like one
falling asleep from exceeding weariness.</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
72</span>Gehulf&egrave; saw the danger of his friend; and though 
he felt the air heavy, his fear for Gottlieb kept him wide 
awake.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are those words,&rdquo; he asked his 
drowsy friend, &ldquo;which burn so brightly in your 
book?&rdquo;&nbsp; When he heard the voice, Gottlieb roused 
himself, and read; and it was written, &ldquo;Watch and pray, 
lest ye enter into temptation; the spirit truly is willing, but 
the flesh is weak.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, for a little while, 
Gottlieb was warned, and he walked like one awake; but, after a 
time, such power had this sleepy air, he was again almost as 
drowsy as ever, and his eyes were nearly closed.&nbsp; Then, 
before Gehulf&egrave; could give him a second warning, he placed 
his foot in a hole, which he would have easily passed by, if he 
had been watching; and, falling suddenly down, he would have 
rolled quite out of the road (for it was raised here with a steep
bank on either side), if Gehulf&egrave; had not been nigh to 
catch him again by the hand, and keep him in the path.&nbsp; He 
<!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>was sorely bruised and shaken by the fall, and his lamp,
too, was dusted and hurt; so that he could not, at first, press 
on the way as he wished to do.&nbsp; But now his drowsiness was 
gone; and, with many bitter tears, he lamented that he had given 
way to it before.&nbsp; One strange thing I noted, too: he had 
dropped his staff in his fall, and he could not rise till he had 
taken it again in his hand; but now, when he tried to take it, it
pricked and hurt his hand, as if it had been rough and sharp with
thorns.&nbsp; Then I looked at it, and saw that one of the stems 
which were twined together, and which bore the name of 
&ldquo;discipline,&rdquo; was very rough and thorny; and this, 
which had turned inwardly before, was now, by his fall, forced to
the outside of the staff, so that he must hold that or 
none.&nbsp; Now I heard the boy groan as he laid hold of it; but 
lay hold of it he did, and that boldly, for he could not rise or 
travel without it, and to rise <!-- page 74--><a 
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and travel he
was determined.&nbsp; Then he looked into his book of light, and 
he read out of it these words, &ldquo;Make the bones which Thou 
hast broken to rejoice.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he read them, he 
gathered courage, and made a great effort, and stood upon his 
feet, and pressed on beside Gehulf&egrave;.</p>
<p>Then I saw that the road changed again, and became smoother 
than they had ever known it.&nbsp; Gottlieb&rsquo;s staff, too, 
was now smooth and easy in his hand, as it had been at 
first.&nbsp; Soon also a pleasant air sprung up, and blew softly 
and yet cool upon their foreheads.&nbsp; And now they heard the 
song of birds, as if the sunshine was very near them, though they
saw it not yet.&nbsp; There were, too, every now and then, sounds
sweeter than the songs of birds, as if blessed angels were near 
them, and they were let to hear their heavenly voices.&nbsp; A 
little further, and the day began to dawn upon them&mdash;bright 
light shone out some way before them, and its glad <!-- page 
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
75</span>reflection was already cast upon their path.&nbsp; But 
still there was one more trial before them; for when they had 
enjoyed this light for a season, and I thought they must be close
upon the sunshine, I saw that they had got into greater darkness 
than ever.&nbsp; Here, also, they lost sight of one another; for 
it was a part of the King&rsquo;s appointment, that each one must
pass that dark part alone&mdash;it was called &ldquo;the shadow 
of death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gehulf&egrave;, I saw, walked through it 
easily; his feet were nimble and active, his lamp was bright, his
golden vial ever in his hand, his staff firm to lean upon, and 
the book of light close before his eyes: he was still reading it 
aloud, and I heard him speak of his King as giving &ldquo;songs 
in the night,&rdquo;&mdash;and so, with a glad heart, he passed 
through the darkness.&nbsp; The brightest sunshine lay close upon
the other side of it; and there he was waited for by messengers 
in robes of light, and they <!-- page 76--><a 
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>clad him in 
the same, and carried him with songs and music into the presence 
of the King.</p>
<p>But Gottlieb did not pass through so easily.&nbsp; It seemed 
as if that darkness had power to bring out any weakness with 
which past accidents had at the time affected the pilgrim: for so
it was, that when Gottlieb was in it, he felt all the stunning of
his fall come back again upon him, and, for a moment, he seemed 
well-nigh lost.&nbsp; But his heart was sound, and there was One 
who was faithful holding him up: so he grasped his good staff 
tighter than ever, though its roughness had come out again and 
sorely pricked his hand; but this seemed only to quicken his 
steps; and when he had gone on a little while thus firmly, as he 
looked into his book he saw written on its open page, &ldquo;I 
will make darkness light before thee.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76" 
class="citation">[76]</a>&nbsp; And as he read them, the words 
seemed to be <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>fulfilled, for he stepped joyfully 
out of the darkness into the clear sunlight.&nbsp; And for him 
too the messengers were waiting; for him too were garments ready 
woven of the light; around him were songs, and music, and 
rejoicing; and so they bare him into the presence of the 
King.</p>
<p>Now, when I had seen these two pass so happily through their 
journey into rest, I thought again of the poor trembling 
Furchtsam, and longed to know that he had got again into the 
road.&nbsp; But upon looking back to where I had lost sight of 
him, I saw that he was still lying at the foot of the steep bank,
down whose side he had stepped so easily.&nbsp; He had toiled and
laboured, and striven to climb up, but it had been all in 
vain.&nbsp; Still he would not cease his labour; and now he was 
but waiting to recover his breath to begin to strive again.&nbsp;
He was, too, continually calling on the King for aid.&nbsp; Then 
I saw a figure approaching him in the midst of <!-- page 78--><a 
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>his 
cries.&nbsp; And poor Furchtsam trembled exceedingly, for he was 
of a very timorous heart, and he scarcely dared to look up to him
who stood by him.&nbsp; After a while I heard the man speak to 
him, and he asked him in a grave, pitying voice, &ldquo;What 
doest thou here?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the poor boy sobbed out in 
broken words the confession of his folly, and told how he had 
feared and left the road, and how he had laboured to get back 
into it, and how he almost thought that he should never reach 
it.&nbsp; Then I saw the man look down upon him with a face of 
tenderness and love; and he stretched forth his hand towards him;
and Furchtsam saw that it was the hand which had been pierced for
him: so he raised the boy up, and set him on his feet; and he led
him straight up the steepest bank.&nbsp; And now it seemed easy 
to his steps; and he put him back again in the road, and gave the
staff into his hand, and bid him &ldquo;redeem the time, because 
<!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>the days are evil;&rdquo; and then he added, 
&ldquo;Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble 
knees.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Say to them that are of a fearful 
heart, &lsquo;be strong:&rsquo; &lsquo;fear not.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a" 
class="citation">[79a]</a>&nbsp; Such strength had his touch, his
words, and his kind look, given to the heart of the timid boy, 
that he seized the staff, though its most prickly 
&ldquo;discipline&rdquo; sorely hurt his tender flesh; and 
leaning on it, he set bravely out without a moment&rsquo;s 
delay.&nbsp; And I heard him reading in his book of light as he 
climbed up the steep path which had affrighted him; and what he 
read was this: &ldquo;Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but 
now have I kept Thy word.&rdquo; <a name="citation79b"></a><a 
href="#footnote79b" class="citation">[79b]</a></p>
<p>When he had almost reached the arbour, another danger awaited 
him; for in the dim light round him he saw, as he thought, the 
form of an evil beast lying in the pathway before him.&nbsp; Then
did some of his old terrors begin to trouble him; and he <!-- 
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
80</span>had turned aside, perhaps, out of the way, but that the 
wholesome roughness of his staff still pricked his hand and 
forced him to recall his former fall.&nbsp; Instead, therefore, 
of turning aside, he looked into his book of light, and there he 
read in fiery letters, &ldquo;Thou shalt go upon the lion and the
adder; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy 
feet:&rdquo; and this gave him comfort.&nbsp; So, on he went, 
determining still to read in his book, and not to look at all at 
that which affrighted him: and so it was, that when he came to 
the place, he saw that it was only a bush, which his fears had 
turned into the figure of a beast of prey; and at the same moment
he found where it was written in his book, &ldquo;No lion shall 
be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall 
not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80" 
class="citation">[80]</a></p>
<p>And now he stood beside the arbour, <!-- page 81--><a 
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>where he 
rested a while, and then pursued his journey.&nbsp; Now I 
noticed, that as he got further on the road, and read more in his
book, and leant upon his staff, that he grew bolder and firmer in
his gait: and I thought that I could see why Gehulf&egrave;, who 
had been needful to him in his first weakness, had afterwards 
been carried away from him: for surely he had leant more upon 
him, and less upon his book and his good staff, unless he had 
walked there alone.</p>
<p>However this might be, he grew continually bolder.&nbsp; As he
drew near the last sad darkness, I began again to tremble for 
him; but I need not have done so; for he walked on so straight 
through it, that it seemed scarcely to make any difference to him
at all.&nbsp; In the best part of the road his feebleness had 
taught him to lean altogether upon Him who had so mercifully 
helped him on the bank, and who had held up his fainting steps 
hitherto; <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>and this strength could hold him up 
as well even in this extreme darkness.&nbsp; I heard him, as he 
parsed along, say, &ldquo;When I am weak, then am I 
strong;&rdquo; and with that he broke out into singing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Through death&rsquo;s dark valley without 
fear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My feeble steps have trod,<br />
Because I know my God is near;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel His staff and rod.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that he too passed out of the shade and darkness into the
joyful sunshine.&nbsp; And oh, it was indeed a happy time!&nbsp; 
It made my heart bound when I saw his face, which had so often 
turned pale and drooped with terror, now lighted up with the glow
of the heavenly light; when, instead of the evil things which his
fears had summoned up, I saw around him the bands of holy ones, 
and the children of the day: and so they passed along.&nbsp; And 
soon, I thought, he would see again the hand which had been 
stretched out to save him on the bank, and hear the kind <!-- 
page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>and merciful voice which had soothed his terror and 
despair, and live in the present sunshine of that gracious 
countenance.</p>
<p>And now methought I heard an earnest and sorrowful voice, as 
of one crying aloud for help; so I turned me round to see where 
he was that uttered it, and by the side of the King&rsquo;s path 
I could see one striving to mount the bank, and slipping back 
again as often as he tried.&nbsp; He was trying in right earnest:
his cries were piteous to hear, and he laboured as if he would 
carry his point by storm.&nbsp; But it was all in vain; the more 
he struggled, the worse his case grew; for the bank, and all the 
path up to it, got so quagged and miry with his eager striving, 
that he seemed farther and farther from getting safely up.&nbsp; 
At last, as he was once more struggling violently up, his feet 
quite slipped from under him, and he fell upon his side: and so 
he lay sobbing and struggling for <!-- page 84--><a 
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>breath, but 
still crying out to the King, who had helped him before, and 
delivered him from the flames of the pit, to help him once more, 
and lift him again into the right way.&nbsp; My heart pitied the 
poor boy, and I looked more closely into his face, and saw that 
it was Irrgeist&mdash;not Irrgeist as he had been when he had 
walked at first with Gottlieb along the road, or as he had been 
when he had first followed the deceitful phantom 
&ldquo;Pleasure&rdquo; out of it,&mdash;but Irrgeist still, 
though brought by his wanderings and his trouble to paleness, and
weariness, and sorrow.&nbsp; Now, whilst I was looking at him, as
he lay in this misery, and longing for some helper to come to 
him, lo, his cries stopped for a moment, and I saw that it was 
because One stood by him and spoke to him.&nbsp; Then I could see
under the mantle, which almost hid Him, that it was the same form
which had visited Furchtsam, and delivered him when he had 
cried.&nbsp; Now, too, I saw <!-- page 85--><a 
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>the hand held
out, and I saw Irrgeist seize it; and it raised him up, and he 
stood upon his feet: and the staff was given to 
him,&mdash;exceeding rough, but needful and trusty; and his lamp 
shone out, and the book of light was his; and his feet were again
in the road.</p>
<p>But I marked well that Irrgeist trod it not as the others had 
done.&nbsp; Truly did he go along it weeping.&nbsp; Whether it 
was that the thought of what he had gone through amongst the 
pitfalls dwelt ever on his mind; or whether it were shame of 
having wandered, I know not,&mdash;but his road seemed evermore 
one of toil and sorrow.&nbsp; Still, in the midst of tears, a 
song was often put into his mouth, and his tongue was ever 
speaking of the great kindness of Him who had restored the 
wanderer: his head, too, was so bowed down, that he marked every 
stone upon the road, and therefore never stumbled; but still his 
speed was little, and his troubles <!-- page 86--><a 
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>were 
many.&nbsp; When he got to the dark part, he had a sore trial: 
his feet seemed too weak and trembling to bear him; and more than
once I heard him cry out, as if he thought that he were again 
between the pitfalls, and the fire were ready to break out upon 
him.&nbsp; But then did it seem as if there were some sweet hopes
given him, and his face brightened up; and in a faint, feeble 
voice, he would break out again into his song and 
thanksgiving.&nbsp; As he drew towards the end, things somewhat 
mended with him; and when he was just upon the sunlight, and 
began to see its brightness through the haze, and to hear the 
voices of the heavenly ones, methought his heart would have 
burst, so did it beat with joy: and withal he smote upon his 
breast, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;And this for me!&nbsp; And this 
for the wanderer!&nbsp; O mercy, choicest mercy!&nbsp; Who is a 
God like unto Thee, that pardonest iniquity?&rdquo;&nbsp; And so 
saying, he <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>entered on the heavenly light, and 
left for ever behind him the darkness and the danger of the 
pitfalls, and the face of shame, and the besetting weakness; for 
he too was clothed in raiment of light, and borne with joy before
the Lord the King.</p>

90</span>The Little Wanderers.</h2>
<p>In a miserable little hovel, built on the edge of a wide and 
desolate common, lived a poor widow woman, who had two 
sons.&nbsp; The eldest of them was quite young, and the least was
scarcely more than an infant.&nbsp; They were dressed in torn and
dirty rags, for the widow had no better clothes to put upon them;
and often they were very hungry and very cold, for she had not 
food or fire with which to feed and warm them.&nbsp; No one 
taught the biggest boy any thing; and as for the poor mother, she
did not know a letter.&nbsp; She had no friends; and the only 
playfellows the little ones ever knew were other children as <!--
page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
91</span>poor, and as dirty, and as untaught as they were 
themselves, from whom they learnt nothing but to say bad words 
and do naughty tricks.&nbsp; Poor children! it was a sad life, 
you would say, which lay before them.</p>
<p>Just at this time the widow was taken very ill with a 
fever.&nbsp; Long she lay in that desolate hut, groaning and 
suffering, and no one knew how ill she was but the little 
children.&nbsp; They would sit and cry by her miserable bed all 
day, for they were very hungry and very sad.&nbsp; When she had 
lain in this state for more than a week, she grew light-headed, 
and after a while died.&nbsp; The youngest child thought she was 
asleep, and that he could not waken her; but the elder boy rushed
weeping out of the house, knowing that she was really dead, and 
that they were left alone in the wide world.</p>
<p>Just at that very moment a man passed by, who looked into the 
pale, thin, hungry <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>face of the sobbing child, with a 
kind, gentle look, and let himself be led into the wretched hut, 
where the poor dead mother lay.&nbsp; His heart bled for the poor
orphans, for he was one who was full of tenderness: so he spake 
kind words to them; and when his servants came up after a while, 
he gave orders that their dead mother should be buried, and that 
the children should be taken from the miserable hut, to dwell in 
his own beautiful castle.</p>
<p>To it the children were removed.&nbsp; The servants of the 
Lord of the castle put on them clean fresh clothes&mdash;washed 
their old dirt from them; and as no one knew what were their 
names, they gave them two new names, which shewed they belonged 
to this family; and they were cared for, and given all they 
wanted.</p>
<p>Happy was now their lot.&nbsp; They had all they wanted: good 
food in plenty, instead of hunger and thirst; clean raiment, <!--
page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
93</span>instead of rags and nakedness; and kind teachers, who 
instructed them day by day as they were able to bear it.&nbsp; 
There were a multitude of other happy children too in the castle,
with whom they lived, and learned, and spent their glad 
days.&nbsp; Sometimes they played in the castle, and sometimes 
they ran about in the grounds that were round it, where were all 
sorts of flowers, and beautiful trees full of singing birds, and 
green grass, and painted butterflies; and they were as happy as 
children could be.</p>
<p>All over these grounds they might play about as they would: 
only on one side of them they were forbidden to go.&nbsp; There 
the garden ended in a wide waste plain, and there seemed to be 
nothing to tempt children to leave the happy garden to walk in 
it, especially as the kind Lord of the castle bid them never set 
foot on it: and yet it was said that some children had wandered 
into it, and that of these, <!-- page 94--><a 
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>many had 
never come back again.&nbsp; For in that desert dwelt the enemies
of the Lord of the castle; and there was nothing they loved 
better than to pounce down upon any children whom he had taken as
his own, and carry them off, to be their slaves in the midst of 
the waste and dreary sands.</p>
<p>Many ways too had these enemies by which they enticed children
to come on the plain; for as long as they stayed within the 
boundary, and played only in the happy garden, the evil one could
not touch them.&nbsp; Sometimes they would drop gay and shining 
flowers all about the beginning of the waste, hoping that the 
children would come across the border to pick them up: and so it 
was, that if once a child went over, as soon as he had got into 
his hands the flower for which he had gone, it seemed to fade and
wither away; but just beyond him he thought he saw another, 
brighter and more beautiful; <!-- page 95--><a 
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>and so, too, 
often it happened that, throwing down the first, he went on to 
take the second; and then throwing down the second, he went on to
reach a third; until, suddenly, the enemy dashed upon him, and 
whirled him away with them in a moment.</p>
<p>Often and often had little K&uuml;hn <a 
name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a" 
class="citation">[95a]</a>&mdash;for so the eldest boy had been 
named&mdash;looked out over this desert, and longed, as he saw 
the gay flowers dropped here and there, to run over the border 
and pick them up.&nbsp; His little brother, who was now old 
enough to run about with him, would stand and tremble by him as 
he got close to the desert; but little Zart <a 
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b" 
class="citation">[95b]</a> would never leave him: and sometimes, 
I am afraid, they would have both been lost, if it had not been 
for a dear little girl, who was almost always with them, and who 
never would go even near to the line.&nbsp; When K&uuml;hn was 
looking into it, as if he longed for <!-- page 96--><a 
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>the painted 
flowers, the gentle Glaube <a name="citation96"></a><a 
href="#footnote96" class="citation">[96]</a> would grow quite 
sad, and bending her dark sorrowful eyes upon him, their long 
lashes would become wet with tears, and she would whisper in a 
voice almost too solemn for a child, &ldquo;O K&uuml;hn, 
remember.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then K&uuml;hn, who could not bear to see 
her sad, would tear himself away; and the flowers seemed directly
to lose their brightness, and the desert looked dry and hot, and 
the garden cool and delicious, and they played happily together, 
and forgot their sorrow.</p>
<p>But it was very dangerous for K&uuml;hn to go so near.&nbsp; 
The servants of the Lord of the castle often told the children 
this; and seeing a bold and daring spirit in K&uuml;hn, they had 
spoken to him over and over again.&nbsp; What made it so 
dangerous was this,&mdash;that the flowers of the wilderness 
never looked gay until you got near to its border; afar off it 
seemed dusty, <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>dry, and hot; but the nearer you got 
to it, the brighter shone the flowers; they seemed also to grow 
in number, until you could hardly see its dry hot sands, for the 
flowery carpet that was drawn over them.</p>
<p>Poor K&uuml;hn! he was often in danger.&nbsp; Never yet had he
crossed the border; but it is a sad thing to go near temptation; 
and so this unhappy child found to his cost.</p>
<p>One day he was sauntering close to the forbidden border, when 
the hoop which he was trundling slipped from him and ran into the
desert.&nbsp; In a moment he was over after it; and just as he 
stooped to pick it up, he saw, right before him, a beautiful and 
sparkling flower.&nbsp; He would certainly have gone after it, 
but that at the instant he caught the eye of Glaube looking sadly
after him, and it struck upon his heart, and he hastened back, 
and was safe.&nbsp; For a while his legs trembled <!-- page 
98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>under
him, and Zart looked up quite frightened into his pale face; 
Glaube too could scarcely speak to him; and it was long before 
they were laughing merrily again under the tall palm-trees of the
garden.&nbsp; But by the next day all K&uuml;hn&rsquo;s fears had
flown away, and he went with a bolder foot than ever to the very 
edge of the desert.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p98.jpg">
<img alt="The Little Wanderers" src="images/p98.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Glaube was further off than usual; and just as K&uuml;hn and 
Zart were in this great danger, a beautiful bird started up under
their feet.&nbsp; The boys had never seen such a bird.&nbsp; All 
the colours of the rainbow shone upon his feathers, and his black
and scarlet head seemed quite to sparkle in the sunshine.&nbsp; 
It tried to fly; but whether its wing was hurt, or what, I know 
not, but it could not rise, and ran before them flapping its 
painted wings, screaming with a harsh voice, and keeping only 
just before them.&nbsp; The boys were soon in full chase, and 
every thing else <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>was forgotten; when, just as they 
thought the bird was their own, he fluttered across the border, 
and both the boys followed him,&mdash;K&uuml;hn boldly and 
without thought, for he had been across it before; but poor 
little Zart trembled and turned pale, and clung to his bolder 
brother, as if he never would have crossed it alone.</p>
<p>Once over, however, on they went, and the bird still seemed to
keep close before them; and they never noticed how far they were 
getting from the garden, until suddenly they heard a dreadful 
noise; the air looked thick before them, as if whole clouds of 
dust were sweeping on; shining spear-heads were all they could 
see in the midst of the dust; and they heard the trampling of a 
multitude of horses.&nbsp; The boys were too much frightened to 
shriek, but they clung to one another, pale and trembling, and 
ready to sink into the earth.&nbsp; In a minute rude hands seized
them; they heard rough voices round <!-- page 100--><a 
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>them; and 
they could see that they were in the midst of the enemies of the 
Lord of the castle.&nbsp; In another minute they were torn 
asunder, they were snatched up on horseback, and were galloping 
off towards the sad abode in which the evil men of the desert 
dwelt.&nbsp; In vain the boys cried, and begged to be taken home;
away galloped the horses; whilst no one thought of heeding their 
cries and prayers.&nbsp; They had gone on long in this way, and 
the dark-frowning towers of the desert castle were in 
sight.&nbsp; The little boys looked sadly at one another; for 
here there was no flowering garden, there were no sheltering 
trees, but all looked bare, and dry, and wretched; and they could
see little narrow windows covered with iron bars, which seemed to
be dungeon-rooms, where they thought they should be barred in, 
and never more play together amongst the flowers and in the 
sunlight.</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>Just at this moment the little Zart felt that, by some 
means or other, the strap which bound him to the horse had grown 
loose, and in another moment he had slipped down its side, and 
fallen upon his head on the ground.&nbsp; No one noticed his 
fall; and there he lay upon the sand for a while stunned and 
insensible.&nbsp; When he woke up, the trampling of horses had 
died away in the distance; the light sand of the desert, which 
their feet had stirred, had settled down again like the heavy 
night-dew, so that he could see no trace of their 
footmarks.&nbsp; The frowning castle-walls were out of sight; 
look which way he would, he could see nothing but the hot flat 
sand below, and the hot bright sun in the clear sky above 
him.&nbsp; He called for his brother, but no voice answered him; 
he started up, and began to run he knew not where: but the sun 
beat on his head, the hot sand scorched his weary feet; his 
parched tongue began to <!-- page 102--><a 
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>cleave to 
his mouth; and he sunk down upon the desert again to die.</p>
<p>As he lay there he thought upon the castle-garden and its kind
Lord; upon the sorrowful face with which Glaube was used to look 
on them, when he and K&uuml;hn drew near to the forbidden border;
and his tears broke out afresh when he thought of his brother in 
the enemies&rsquo; dungeon, and himself dying in the desolate 
wilderness.&nbsp; Then he called upon the Lord of the castle, for
he remembered to have heard how He had pitied wandering children,
and heard their cry from afar, and had brought them back again to
His own happy castle.&nbsp; And as he lay upon the sand, crying 
out to the Lord of the castle, he thought that he heard a 
footstep, as of one walking towards him.&nbsp; Then there came a 
shade between the sun and his burning head, and looking languidly
up he saw the kind face of the Lord of the castle turned towards 
him.&nbsp; He was looking on <!-- page 103--><a 
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the poor 
child as He had looked on him when He had pitied him by the side 
of the hut; and that kind face seemed to speak comfort.&nbsp; 
Then He stretched out to him His hand, and He bade him rise; and 
He lifted up the child, and bore him in His bosom over that waste
and scorching wilderness, nor ever set him down until He had 
brought him again into the pleasant garden.&nbsp; Once as he lay 
in that bosom, Zart thought that he heard in the distance the 
tramping of horse-hoofs; and he saw the dusty cloud lifting 
itself up: but he felt that he was safe; and so he was, for the 
enemy did not dare to approach that Mighty One who was bearing 
him.</p>
<p>When he reached the garden again, the gentle Glaube met him, 
and welcomed him back again to their peaceful home.&nbsp; But he 
hung down his head with shame and with sorrow; and as he looked 
up into the face of the Lord of the garden, he saw <!-- page 
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>in
it such kindness and love, that his tears rolled down his cheeks 
to think how he had broken His command, and wandered into the 
wilderness of His enemies.&nbsp; Then he tried to speak for his 
brother, for his heart was sore and heavy with thinking of him; 
but the Lord of the castle answered not.&nbsp; Many, many days 
did Glaube and Zart pray for him; but they heard nothing of him: 
whether he died in the enemies&rsquo; dungeon; or whether, as 
they still dared to hope, he might even yet one day find his way 
back to the garden of peace; or whether, as they sometimes 
trembled to think, he had grown up amongst the enemies of their 
Lord, and become one of them,&mdash;they knew not, and they dared
not to ask.&nbsp; But they never thought of him without trembling
and tears, and Zart more even than Glaube: for he had crossed

<h2>The King and his Servants.</h2>
<p><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>A great king once called his servants to him, and said 
to them,&mdash;&ldquo;You have all often professed to love me, 
and to wish to serve me; and I have never yet made trial of 
you.&nbsp; But now I am about to try you all, that it may be 
known who does in truth desire to serve me, and who is a servant 
only in name.&nbsp; To morrow your trial will begin; so meet me 
here in the morning, and be ready to set out upon a journey on 
which I shall send you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had so spoken, he left them; and there was a 
great deal of bustle and talking amongst these servants.&nbsp; 
Not that they were all alike.&nbsp; Some were very <!-- page 
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
110</span>busy, and said a great deal of the services they should
render; and that they hoped it would be some really hard trial on
which the king would set them.&nbsp; Others were quiet and 
thoughtful, saying little or nothing, but, as it seemed, thinking
silently of the words the king had spoken, as if they feared lest
they should fail in their trial.&nbsp; For they loved that king 
greatly; he had been as a father to them all.&nbsp; Once they had
been slaves, and cruelly treated by a wicked tyrant who had taken
them prisoners, and cast some of them into dungeons, and made 
others work in dark mines, and dealt evil with them all.&nbsp; 
But the king had triumphed over this their enemy, and rescued 
them from his hands.&nbsp; His own son had sought them in the 
dungeons and dark pits into which they had been cast, and had 
brought them out; and now he had given them places in his 
service, and fed them from his own kingly table; and he promised 
to such as were <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>faithful, that he would raise them 
yet higher; that he would even set them upon thrones, and put 
crowns upon their heads; and that they should remain always in 
his presence, and rule and dwell with him.&nbsp; Now, when the 
time of their trial was come, these faithful servants were grave 
and thoughtful, fearing lest they should fail, and be led to 
forget him their kind and gracious king.&nbsp; But one thought 
held them up.&nbsp; He had said unto them all, &ldquo;As your 
day, so shall your strength be.&rdquo;&nbsp; They knew, 
therefore, that he would put on them no task beyond their 
strength.&nbsp; They remembered his kindness and his love in 
taking them out of the dungeons of the enemy.&nbsp; They desired 
greatly to serve him; and so they rejoiced that their trial was 
come, even while they feared it; and they trusted in him to help 
them, even whilst they trembled for themselves.</p>
<p>These servants spent much of the night in preparing for their 
journey; in thinking <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>over all the directions the king had
ever given them; for many times had he spoken to them of this 
coming trial; and even written down plain rules for them, which 
should teach them always how he would have them act.&nbsp; All 
these they gathered together, lest in the hurry of setting out, 
they should forget any one of them; and so they went into the 
court of the palace to meet the king.</p>
<p>Then he came forth from his palace-door, and gave them all 
their charge.</p>
<p>From the great treasure-chambers of that palace he brought out
many different gifts, and laid them before these his 
servants.&nbsp; One had gold and silver, and another had precious
stuffs; but all had something good and costly: and as he gave 
them these gifts, he told them that this was to be their 
trial.&nbsp; He was about to send them with these gifts into an 
exceeding great and rich city, which lay afar off from his 
palace; and in that city they <!-- page 113--><a 
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>were all to
trade for him.&nbsp; They were to take his gifts and use them 
wisely, so that each one of them might bring something back to 
him.&nbsp; He gave them also very close and particular 
instructions.&nbsp; He told them that there were many in that 
city who would try to rob them of these his gifts; and he told 
them how to keep them safely.&nbsp; He told them that many would 
seek to make them waste what he had given to them on pleasing 
themselves.&nbsp; But that they must remember always, that what 
they had belonged to him; that they would have to give him an 
account of their way of using all his gifts; and that of his mere
mercy he, who had redeemed them from the dungeon and made them 
able to serve him, would graciously reward hereafter all their 
efforts to use his gifts for him.&nbsp; He told them also to set 
about trading for him as early as they could; for that all the 
merchants&rsquo; goods were freshest in the morning; that then 
the precious stones were the finest and the <!-- page 114--><a 
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>truest; but
that those who waited till the evening would find all the best 
goods sold; and that, perhaps, before they had any thing ready, 
the trumpet would sound which was to call them all out of the 
city, and then they would have to come back to him empty-handed 
and disgraced.</p>
<p>When he had given them these charges, he sent them from his 
presence to begin their journey to the great city.&nbsp; All that
day they travelled with horses and camels over plains and hills, 
and fruitful fields and deserts, until, just as the sun went 
down, they came to the walls of a great city; and they knew that 
it was here they were to traffic for their king upon the 
morrow.</p>
<p>Then the thoughtful servants began carefully to unpack their 
goods; they looked into their bales of precious stuffs to see 
that they had got no injury from the dust and sand of the desert;
they counted over their bags of money to see that all was right; 
and began to lay them all in order, <!-- page 115--><a 
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>that they 
might enter the town as soon as the gates were open, and trade 
for their king in the morning hours, which he had told them were 
the best.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p115.jpg">
<img alt="The King and His Servants" src="images/p115.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But some of the other servants laughed at them for taking all 
this care and trouble.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely it will be time 
enough,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;to get every thing ready when 
the markets are open to-morrow.&nbsp; We have had a long, hot, 
weary journey, and we must rest and refresh ourselves before we 
think of trading.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they spread the tables, and 
began to feast in a riotous way, quite forgetting the 
king&rsquo;s service, and putting the morrow out of their 
thoughts.</p>
<p>Now as soon as the sun was up, in the morning, there was a 
great stir amongst the servants.&nbsp; Those who had been careful
and watchful in the evening were ready with all their bales; and 
as soon as ever the city-gates were open, they marched in through
them with their goods.&nbsp; It was a great wide city into which 
they entered, <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>and must hold, they thought, a vast 
multitude of men.&nbsp; Houses and streets of all sizes met their
eyes here and there; but they passed easily along, because it was
still so early in the morning, that few persons were in the 
streets, and those few were all bent upon business, as they were 
themselves.&nbsp; So they passed on to the great market where the
merchants bought and sold, and here they set out all their goods;
and the merchants came round them to look over their wares, and 
to shew them what they had to sell in return.&nbsp; Now they 
found it true as the king had foretold them.&nbsp; For they had 
the first choice of all that the merchants could offer.&nbsp; One
of them opened his stores, and shewed them rubies, and diamonds, 
and pearls, such as they had never seen before for size and 
beauty.&nbsp; So they chose a pearl of great price, and they 
bought it for their prince, and they trafficked in their other 
wares, and gained for him <!-- page 117--><a 
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>more than 
as many bags of treasure as he had given them at first.&nbsp; 
Thus they traded according to their skill, and every one had now 
secured something for his lord.&nbsp; The pearl of great price 
was stored by some; others had rich dresses adorned with gold and
precious stones; others had bags of the most refined gold; others
had the spices of Arabia and the frankincense of the islands of 
the East.</p>
<p>One there was amongst them who seemed to have got nothing to 
carry home with him; and yet he, as well as the rest, had laid 
out his master&rsquo;s gifts.&nbsp; Then some of the other 
servants asked him, what he had stored up for the king? and he 
said that he had no riches which he could shew to them, but that 
he had an offering which he knew that the merciful heart of the 
king would make him love and value.&nbsp; Then they asked him to 
tell them his story; so he said that, as he was walking through 
the market, he had seen a poor <!-- page 118--><a 
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>woman 
weeping and wringing her hands, as if her heart would break: he 
stopped, and asked her the cause of her sorrow; and she told him 
that she was a widow, and that some merchants, to whom her 
husband had owed large sums of money, had come that morning to 
her house and taken all that she had, and seized her children 
too; and that they were dragging them away to the slave-market to
sell them for slaves in a far land, that they might pay 
themselves the debt which her husband had owed them.&nbsp; So 
when he heard her sad tale, he opened his bag of treasure, and 
found that all the gold which he had got in it would just pay the
widow&rsquo;s debt and set her children free.&nbsp; Then he went 
with her to the merchants, and he told out to them all that sum, 
and set the children of the widow free, and gave them back to 
their mother; &ldquo;and I am taking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to 
our merciful king the offering of the widow&rsquo;s tears and 
gratitude; and I know <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>well that this is an offering which 
will be well-pleasing in his sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it fared with these faithful servants in their trading; and
all the while they were cheerful and light-hearted, because they 
remembered constantly the love and kindness which their king had 
shewed to them; and they rejoiced that they were able to serve 
him and to trade for him with his gifts.&nbsp; They thought also 
of the goodness of the king&rsquo;s son towards them; they 
remembered how he had sought them when they were prisoners in the
dark dungeons of their tyrant enemy; and they were full of joy 
when they thought that they should be able to offer to him the 
goodly pearl, and the other curious gifts, which they had 
bought.&nbsp; They thought of these things until they longed to 
hear the trumpet sound, which was to call them out of the town 
and gather them together for their journey home.&nbsp; When that 
trumpet might sound, they knew not; but the <!-- page 120--><a 
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>sun was now
passed its noon, and the town, which had been so quiet when they 
came in the early morning along its empty streets, was now full 
of noise, and bustle, and confusion, as great towns are wont to 
be, when all the multitude of sleepers awaken and pour out for 
pleasure, or business, or idleness, into the streets, and 
squares, and market-places.</p>
<p>Heartily glad were they now that they had been so early at 
their traffic.&nbsp; Now the merchants had shut up all their 
richest stores; and the markets were full of others who brought 
false pearls and mock diamonds, instead of the costly gems for 
which they had traded in the morning.&nbsp; There seemed to be 
hardly any true traders left.&nbsp; Idlers were there in numbers,
and shows and noisy revels were passing up and down the streets; 
and they could see thieves and bad men lurking about at all the 
corners, seeking whom they could catch, and rob, and plunder.</p>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>On all these things the servants looked; sometimes they
saw beautiful sights pass by them, which gladdened their eyes; 
and sometimes sweet music would fill their ears, as bands of 
merry harpers and singers walked up and down through the market; 
and they rejoiced in all of these, but still their hearts were 
full of thoughts of their kind king, and recollections of his son
their prince; and they longed to be at home with them, even when 
the sights round them were the gayest, and the sounds in their 
ears were the sweetest; and they were ever watching for the voice
of the trumpet, which was to call them again homeward.</p>
<p>But this happy case was not that of all the servants.&nbsp; 
When these watchful men had been entering the gates of the city 
in the morning, the thoughtless servants were not yet 
awake.&nbsp; They had sat up late at their feasting and 
rejoicings, and when the morning sun rose upon them, they <!-- 
page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
122</span>were still in their first deep sleep.&nbsp; The 
stirring of their fellow-servants moved them a little, and for a 
while they seemed ready to rise and join them.&nbsp; But their 
goods were not ready, so they could not go with them; and they 
might as well, therefore, they thought, wait a little longer and 
rest themselves, and then follow them to the market.&nbsp; They 
did not mean to be late, but they saw no reason why they should 
be so very early.</p>
<p>They slept, therefore, till the sun was high, and then they 
rose in some confusion, because it was now so late; and they had 
all their goods to unpack, their stuffs to smooth out, and the 
dust to shake off from them.&nbsp; Soon they began about every 
little thing to find fault with one another, because they were 
secretly angry with themselves.&nbsp; Each one thought that if 
his neighbour had not persuaded him to stay, he should have been 
up, and have entered the city with the earliest: so high words 
<!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
123</span>arose between them; and instead of helping one another,
and making the best they could of the time which remained, they 
only hindered one another, and made it later and later before 
they were ready to begin their trading.</p>
<p>At length, after many hard words and much bad temper, one by 
one they got away; each as soon as he was ready, and often with 
his goods all in confusion; every one following his own path, and
wandering by himself up the crowded streets of the full town.</p>
<p>Hard work they had to get at all along it when they had passed
the gates.&nbsp; All the stream of people seemed now to be 
setting against them.&nbsp; The idlers jested upon their strange 
dress; and if they did but try to traffic for their lord, the 
rude children of the town would gather round them, and hoot, and 
cry: so that they could not manage to carry on any trade at 
all.</p>
<p><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Then, as I watched them, I saw that some who had been 
the loudest in talking of what they should do when they were 
tried, were now the first to give up altogether making any head 
at all against the crowd of that city.&nbsp; They packed up what 
goods they might have, and began to think only of looking about 
them, and following the crowd, and pleasing themselves, like any 
of the men around them.&nbsp; Then I looked after some of these, 
and I saw that one of them was led on by the crowd to a place in 
the town where there was a great show.&nbsp; Outside of it were 
men in many-coloured dresses, who blew with trumpets, and jested,
and cried aloud, and begged all to come in and see the strange 
sights which were stored within.</p>
<p>Now when the servant came to this place, he watched one and 
another go in, until at last he also longed to go in and see the 
sights which were to be gazed on within.&nbsp; So he went to the 
door, and the <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>porter asked him for money; but when
he drew out his purse, and the porter saw that his money belonged
to some strange place, and was quite unlike the coin used in that
town, he only laughed at it, and said it was good for nothing 
there, and bid him &ldquo;stand back.&rdquo;&nbsp; So as he 
turned away, the porter saw the rich bundle on his back, and then
he spoke to him in another tone, and he said, &ldquo;I will let 
you in, if you like to give me that bundle of goods.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then for a moment the servant was checked.&nbsp; He thought of 
his lord and of the reckoning, and he remembered the words, 
&ldquo;As good stewards of the manifold grace of God;&rdquo; and 
he had almost determined to turn back, and to fight his way to 
the market-place, and to trade for his lord, let it cost him what
it might;&mdash;but just at the moment there was a great burst of
the showman&rsquo;s trumpets; and he heard the people shouting 
for joy within; and so he forgot all but <!-- page 126--><a 
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>his great 
desire, and slipping off the bundle from his shoulders, he put it
into the hands of the porter, and passed in, and I saw him no 
more.</p>
<p>Then I saw another, who was standing at the corner of a street
gating at some strange antics which were being played by a 
company of the townsmen.&nbsp; And as he gazed upon them, he 
forgot all about his trading for his master, and thought only of 
seeing more of this strange sight.&nbsp; Then I saw that whilst 
he was thinking only of these follies, some evil-minded men 
gathered round him, and before he was aware of it, they secretly 
stole from him all the gold which his lord had given him to lay 
out for him.&nbsp; The servant did not even know when it was 
gone, so much was he thinking of staring at the sight before 
him.&nbsp; But it made me very sad to think that when he went to 
buy for his master, he would find out, too late, his loss; and 
that when the trumpet sounded, <!-- page 127--><a 
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>he would 
have nothing to carry back with him on the day of reckoning.</p>
<p>Some of these loiterers, too, were treated even worse than 
this.&nbsp; One of them I saw whom the shows and lights of that 
town led on from street to street, until he came quite to its 
farther end; and then he thought that he saw before him, beyond 
some lonely palings, still finer sights than any he had left; and
so he set out to cross over those fields, and see those 
sights.&nbsp; And when he was half over, some wicked robbers, who
laid wait in those desolate places, rushed out upon him from 
their lurking-place, and ill used him sorely, and robbed him of 
all his goods and money, and left him upon the ground hardly able
to get back to the town which he had left.</p>
<p>Then I saw one of these loiterers who, as he was looking idly 
at the sights round him, grew very grave, and began to tremble 
from head to foot.&nbsp; One of his fellows, <!-- page 128--><a 
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>who stood 
by and saw him, quickly asked him what made him tremble.&nbsp; At
first he could not answer; but after a while he said, that the 
sound of the trumpet which they had just heard had made him think
of the great trumpet-sound of their master, which was to call 
them all back to his presence, and that he trembled because the 
evening was coming on, and he had not yet traded for his 
lord.&nbsp; And &ldquo;How,&rdquo; he said in great fear, 
&ldquo;how shall we ever stand that reckoning with our hands 
empty?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then some of his companions in idleness 
laughed and jeered greatly, and mocked the poor trembler.&nbsp; 
But his fears were wiser than their mockings; and so, it seemed, 
he knew, for he cared nothing for them; but only said to them, 
very sadly and gravely, &ldquo;You are in the same danger, how 
then can you jeer at me?&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that he pointed 
their eyes up to the sky, and shewed them how low the sun had got
already, and that it <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>wanted but an hour at the most to 
his setting, and then that the trumpet might sound at any moment,
and they have nothing to bear home to their lord.</p>
<p>Now, as he spoke, one listened eagerly to him; and whilst the 
others jeered, he said very gravely, &ldquo;What can we do?&nbsp;
Is it quite too late?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is never too 
late,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;till the trumpet sounds; and 
though we have lost so much of the day, perchance we can yet do 
something: come with me to the market-place, and we will 
try.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the other joined him, and off they set, 
passing through their companions, who shouted after them all the 
way they went, until the townsmen who stood round began to jeer 
and shout after them also: so that all the town was moved.&nbsp; 
A hard time those two had now, and much they wished that they had
gone to the market-place in the early morning, when the streets 
were empty, and the busy servants had passed so easily 
along.&nbsp; <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>Many were the rough words they had 
now to bear; many the angry, or ill-natured, crowd through which 
they had to push; and if any where they met one of their late and
idle companions, he was sure to stir up all the street against 
them, when he saw them pushing on to the market-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that we shall ever get there?&rdquo; said 
he who had been moved by the other&rsquo;s words to him, who led 
the way, and buffeted with the crowd, like a man swimming through
many rough waves in the strong stream of some swift river.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Do you think that we shall ever get there?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;we shall get there
still, if we do but persevere.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is so 
hard to make any way, and the streets seem to grow fuller and 
fuller; I am afraid that I shall never get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as he spoke, a great band of the townspeople, with music,
and trumpets, <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>and dancing, met them like a mighty 
wave of the sea, and seemed sure to drive them back: one of their
old companions was dancing amongst the rest; and as I looked hard
at him, I saw that it was the same who had given away his 
precious burden in order to go into the show.&nbsp; Now, as soon 
as he saw these his former fellows, he called to them by their 
names, and bid them join him and the townsmen round him.&nbsp; 
But he that was leading the way shook his head, and said boldly: 
&ldquo;No: we will not join with you; we are going to the 
market-place to traffic for our lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is 
too late for that,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you lost the morning, 
and now you cannot trade.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I saw that he who 
before had trembled exceedingly grew very pale; but still he held
on his way; and he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, we have lost the 
morning, and a sore thing it is for us; but our good lord will 
help us even yet; and we <span class="smcap">will</span> serve 
him, &lsquo;redeeming the <!-- page 132--><a 
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>time, 
because the days are evil.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he turned to 
the other and said to him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will not you stop either?&nbsp; Do not be fooled by
this madman: what use is it to go to buy when the shops are all 
shut, and the market empty?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he hung down his 
head, and looked as though he would have turned back, and fallen 
into the throng; but his fellow seized him by the hand, and bid 
him take courage, and think upon his kind master, and upon the 
king&rsquo;s son, whose very blood had been shed for them; and 
with that he seemed to gather a little confidence, and held for a
while on in his way with the other.</p>
<p>Then their old companion turned all his seeming love into 
hatred, and he called upon the crowd round him to lay hands on 
them and stop them; and this the rabble would fain have done, but
that, as it seemed to me, a power greater than their own was with
those servants, and strengthened them; until they pushed the <!--
page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
133</span>rude people aside on the right and on the left, and 
passed safely through them into another street.</p>
<p>Here there were fewer persons, and they had a breathing-time 
for a while; and as they heard the sound of music and of the 
crowd passing by at some little distance from them, they began to
gather heart, and to talk to one another.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never 
thought,&rdquo; said the one, &ldquo;that I could have held on 
through that crowd; and I never could, if you had not stretched 
out your hand to help me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Say, rather, if our
master&rsquo;s strength had not been with us,&rdquo; said the 
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;But do you think,&rdquo; said he that was 
fearful, &ldquo;that he will accept any thing we can bring him 
now, when the best part of the day is over?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a good 
hope that he will; for I remember how he said, &lsquo;Return, ye 
backsliding children, return ye even unto me.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But how can one who is so trembling <!-- page 134--><a 
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>and fearful
as I am ever traffic for him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You can, if you
will but hold on; for he has once spoken of his servants 
&lsquo;as faint yet pursuing.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I wish that I had your
courage; but I do believe that I should not dare to meet such 
another crowd as that we have just passed through; I really 
thought that they would tear us in pieces.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Our king will never let that be,&rdquo; said the other, 
&ldquo;if only we trust in him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But are you 
sure,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that our king does see us in this
town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as he said this, and before his companion had time to 
answer him again, they heard a louder noise than ever, of men 
dancing, and singing, and crowding, and music playing, and horns 
blowing, as if all the mad sports of the city were coming upon 
them in one burst.&nbsp; At the front of all they could see their
old companion; for the band had turned round by a different 
street, and now were just beginning <!-- page 135--><a 
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>to come 
down that one up which they were passing.&nbsp; Then he who had 
been affrighted before, turned white as snow; and he looked this 
way and that, to see what he could do.</p>
<p>Now it so happened, that just by where they stood was a great 
shop, and in its windows there seemed to shine precious stones 
and jewels, and fine crystals, and gold and ivory.&nbsp; And, as 
he looked, his eyes fell full upon the shop, and he said to his 
fellow,&mdash;&ldquo;Look here; surely here is what we want: let 
us turn in here and traffic for our master, and then we shall 
escape all this rout which is coming upon us.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;we must push on to 
the market; that is our appointed place; there our lord bids us 
trade: we must not turn aside from the trouble which our lateness
has brought upon us&mdash;we must not offer to our master that 
which costs us nothing.&nbsp; Play the man, and we shall soon be 
in the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;But we shall be torn in pieces,&rdquo; said the 
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at the great crowd: and even now it 
seems that our old companion sees me, and is beginning to lead 
the rabble upon us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; said 
he who led the way; &ldquo;our king will keep us.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people who have set 
themselves against us round about.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I saw that he to whom he spoke did not seem to hear these
last words, for the master of the shop had noticed how he cast 
his eyes upon the goods that were in the window, and was ready in
a moment to invite him in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; 
he said, &ldquo;before the crowd sweep you away; come in and buy 
my pearls, and my diamonds, and my precious stones; come in, come
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; And while he halted for a moment to parley with 
the man, the crowd came upon them, and he was parted from his 
friend, who had held up his fainting steps; and so he <!-- page 
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
137</span>sprung trembling into the shop, scarcely thinking 
himself safe even there.</p>
<p>Now the man into whose house he had turned, though he was a 
fair-spoken man, and one who knew well how to seem honest and 
true, was altogether a deceiver.&nbsp; All his seeming jewels, 
and diamonds, and pearls, were but shining and painted glass, 
which was worth nothing at all to him who was so foolish as to 
buy it: but this the servant knew not.&nbsp; If it had been in 
the bright clear light of the morning, he would easily have seen 
that the diamonds and the pearls were only sparkling and painted 
glass, and the gold nothing but tinsel; but the bright light of 
the morning had passed away, and in the red slanting light of the
evening sun he could not see clearly; and so the false man 
persuaded him, and he parted with all the rich treasures which 
his king had given him, and got nothing for them in exchange 
which was worth the having, for he filled his <!-- page 138--><a 
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>bag with 
bits of painted glass, which his lord would never accept.</p>
<p>However, he knew not how he had been cheated; or if, perhaps, 
a thought crossed his mind that all was not right, it was 
followed by another, which said that it was now too late to 
alter, and that if he had chosen wrongly, still he must abide by 
it; and so he waited for the trumpet.&nbsp; But he was not 
altogether happy; and often and often he wished that he had faced
the strife of the multitude, and pressed on with his trusting 
companion to the market.</p>
<p>A hard struggle had been his before he had reached it.&nbsp; 
It seemed indeed at times as if the words of his fearful 
companion were coming true, and he would be torn altogether in 
pieces, so fiercely did the crowd press upon him and throng 
him.&nbsp; But as I watched him in the thickest part of it, I saw
that always, just at his last need, something seemed to favour 
him, <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>and the crowd broke off and left 
room for him to struggle by.&nbsp; I could hear him chanting, as 
it were, to himself, when the crowd looked upon him the most 
fiercely, &ldquo;I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the 
people that have set themselves against me round 
about.&rdquo;&nbsp; And even as he chanted the words, the crowd 
divided itself in two parts, like a rushing stream glancing by 
some black rock; and on he passed, as though they saw him 
not.</p>
<p>So it continued, even till he reached the market-place.&nbsp; 
Right glad was he to find himself there: but even now all his 
trials were not over.&nbsp; Many of the stalls were empty, and 
from many more the fair and true traders were gone away; and 
instead of them were come false and deceitful men, who tried to 
put off any who dealt with them with pretended jewels and bad 
goods.</p>
<p>Then did he look anxiously round and round the market, fearing
every moment <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>lest the trumpet should sound before
he had purchased any thing for his lord.&nbsp; Never, perhaps, 
all along the way, did he so bitterly regret his early sloth as 
now, for he wrung his hands together, and said in great 
bitterness, &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;How shall 
I, a loiterer, traffic for my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his eyes fell upon a shop where were no jewels, nor gold,
nor costly silks, nor pearls of great price; but all that was in 
it was coarse sackcloth, and rough and hairy garments, and heaps 
of ashes, and here and there a loaf of bitter bread, and bitter 
herbs, and bottles wherein tears were stored.&nbsp; As he gazed 
on this shop something seemed to whisper to his heart, &ldquo;Go 
and buy.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he went with his sorrowful heart, as one
not worthy to traffic for his master, and he bought the coarsest 
sackcloth, and the ashes of affliction, and many bitter tears: 
and so he waited for the sounding of the trumpet.</p>
<p><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Then suddenly, as some loud noise breaks upon the 
slumbers of men who sleep, that great trumpet sounded.&nbsp; All 
through the air came its voice, still waxing louder and louder; 
and even as it pealed across the sky, all that great city, and 
its multitudes, and its lofty palaces, and its show, and its 
noise, and its revels, all melted away, and were not.&nbsp; And 
in a moment all the servants were gathered together, and their 
lord and king stood amongst them.&nbsp; All else was gone, and 
they and their works were alone with him.</p>
<p>Then was there a fearful trial of every man&rsquo;s 
work.&nbsp; Then were they crowned with light and gladness who 
had risen early and traded diligently, and who now brought before
their master the fruit of that toil, and labour, and pain.&nbsp; 
Each one had his own reward; and amongst the richest and the 
best&mdash;as though he brought what the king greatly 
loved&mdash;was his reward who brought unto his master the <!-- 
page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
142</span>offering of gratitude from the broken-hearted 
widow.</p>
<p>Then drew near the servant who had wasted the morning, but had
repented of his sloth, and had fought his way through the crowds,
and had at last bought the sackcloth.&nbsp; Now he came bringing 
it with him; and it looked poor, and mean, and coarse, as he bore
it amongst the heaps of gold, and jewels, and silks, which lay 
piled up all around; yet did he draw near unto the king; and as 
he came, he spoke, and said, &ldquo;A broken and a contrite heart
wilt thou not despise.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he spake, the king 
looked graciously upon him: a mild and an approving smile sat 
upon his countenance, and he spoke to him also the blessed words,
&ldquo;Well done, thou good and faithful servant.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Then did the coarse sackcloth shine as the most rich cloth of 
gold; then did the ashes of the furnace sparkle as a 
monarch&rsquo;s jewels; whilst every bitter tear which was stored
<!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
143</span>in the bottle changed into pearls and rubies which were
above all price.</p>
<p>Then the king turned to the careless servants, and his voice 
was terrible to hear, and from his face they fled away.&nbsp; I 
dared not to look upon them; but I heard their just and most 
terrible sentence, and I knew that they were driven away for ever
from the presence of the king, in which is life and peace; and 
that they were bound under chains and darkness, deeper and more 
dreadful than those from which the king&rsquo;s son had 
graciously delivered them.</p>

<p>F.&nbsp; Who is the King who called his servants thus 
together?</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; Almighty God.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; Who are meant by these servants trading in the 
town?</p>
<p><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>C.&nbsp; All of us Christians.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; How do you know that they were Christians?</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; Because they had been delivered from slavery and 
dungeons by the King&rsquo;s own Son.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; What is the great town to which they were sent?</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; This world.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; What are the goods which God gave them to lay out for
him?</p>

easy to pass, and the markets full of rich goods?</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; That this service of God is far easier to such as 
begin to serve Him in youth; and that such are able to offer to 
Him the best gifts of early devotion, and their first love, and 
the zeal of youth, and tender hearts, and unclouded 
consciences.</p>

which God gives to those who seek earnestly to turn away from all
iniquity.</p>

into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of 
teeth.&rdquo; <a name="citation148a"></a><a href="#footnote148a"

<h2><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>The Prophet&rsquo;s Guard.</h2>
<p>It was the very earliest morning.&nbsp; The day was not 
breaking as it does in this land of England, with a dewy twilight
and a gradual dawning&mdash;first a dull glow all over the east, 
then blood-red rays, catching any fleecy cloud which is stealing 
over the sky, and turning all its misty whiteness into gold and 
fire;&mdash;but day was breaking as it does in those eastern 
countries&mdash;sudden, and bright, and hot.&nbsp; Darkness flew 
away as at a word; the thick shadows were all at once gone, and 
the broad glaring sun rose proudly in the sky, rejoicing in his 
strength.&nbsp; The people of the town woke up again to life and 
business.&nbsp; Doors were flung wide open, <!-- page 150--><a 
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>and some 
were passing through them; the flat roofs of the houses began to 
be peopled&mdash;on one was a man praying, on others two or three
standing together; but most of the people were hastening here and
there to get through their necessary work before the full heat of
the day came on; numbers were passing and repassing to the clear 
dancing fountain, the cool waters of which bubbled up in the 
midst of a broad square within that city.</p>
<p>And now, what is it which one suddenly sees, and, after gazing
at it for a while, points out to another, and he to a 
third?&nbsp; As each hears, they look eagerly up to the hill, 
which rises high above their town, until they gather into a knot;
and then, as one and another are added to their company, grow 
into almost a crowd.&nbsp; Still it is in the same quarter that 
all eyes are fixed; their water-vessels are set idly down, as if 
they could <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>not think of them.&nbsp; Those which
were set under the fountain have been quite full this long time, 
but no one stooped to remove them; and the water has been running
over their brimming sides, while its liquid silver flew all round
in a shower of sparkling drops.&nbsp; But no one thinks of 
them.&nbsp; What is it which so chains all eyes and fixes the 
attention of all?</p>
<p>The hill is quite full of armed men.&nbsp; There were none 
there overnight: they have come up from the vale silently and 
stealthily during the darkness, while men slept, like some great 
mist rising in stillness from the waters, and they seem to be 
hemming in the town on every side.&nbsp; Look which way you will,
the sun lights upon the burnished points of spears, or falls on 
strong shields, or flashes like lightning from polished and 
cutting swords, or is thrown a thousand ways by the rolling 
wheels of those war-chariots.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; 
is the question <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>of all; and no one likes to say what
all have felt for a long time&mdash;&ldquo;they are our enemies, 
and we are their prey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there is no use in shutting the eyes any longer to the 
truth.&nbsp; The morning breeze has just floated off in its airy 
waves that flag which before hung down lifelessly by the side of 
its staff.&nbsp; It has shewn all.&nbsp; They are enemies; they 
are fierce and bitter enemies; they are the Syrians, and they are
at war with Israel.</p>
<p>But why are they come against this little town?&nbsp; When 
they have licked up it and its people like the dust from the face
of the earth, they will be scarcely further on in their war 
against Israel.&nbsp; Why did not they begin with some of the 
great and royal cities?&nbsp; Why was it not against Jerusalem, 
or Jezreel, or even against the newly rebuilt Jericho?&nbsp; Why 
should they come against this little town?</p>
<p>Then one, an evil-looking man of a dark countenance, one who 
feared not God <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>and loved not His servants, 
whispered to those around him, and said, &ldquo;Have you not 
heard how Elisha the prophet, who dwells amongst us, has 
discovered to the king of Israel the secrets of the army of the 
king of Syria?&nbsp; No doubt it is because Elisha is dwelling 
here that the king of Syria has come upon us.&nbsp; And now shall
we, and our wives, and our sweet babes, and our houses, and our 
treasures, become the prey of the king of Syria, for the sake of 
this Elisha.&nbsp; I never thought that good would come from his 
dwelling here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, fear makes men cruel and suspicious, and fills their 
minds with hard thoughts; and many of these men were full of 
fear: and so, when they heard these words, they began to have 
hard bad thoughts of God&rsquo;s prophet, and to hate him, as the
cause of all the evils which they were afraid would very soon 
come upon them.</p>
<p><!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>Just then the door of another house opened: it was the 
prophet&rsquo;s house, and his servant came forth with the 
water-vessels to fill them at the fountain.&nbsp; He wondered to 
see the crowd of men gathered together, and he drew near to ask 
them what was stirring.&nbsp; He could read upon their dark 
scowling faces that something moved them exceedingly; but what it
was he could not gather.&nbsp; He could not tell why they would 
scarcely speak to him, but looked on him with angry faces, and 
spoke under their breath, and said, &ldquo;This is one of 
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twere best to give them 
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They will destroy us all.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Then the man was altogether astonished; for his master had been 
ever humble, and kind, and gentle; no poor man had ever turned 
away without help when he had come in his sorrows to the prophet 
of the Lord.&nbsp; And yet, why were they thus angry with him, if
it were not for his master&rsquo;s sake?</p>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>Broken sentences were all that he could gather; but, by
little and little, he learned what they feared and what they 
threatened; he saw, also, the hosts of armed men gathered all 
around the city; and his heart, also, was filled with fear.&nbsp;
He believed that it was for his master&rsquo;s sake that they 
were there; he saw that all around him were turned against his 
master, and he trembled exceedingly.&nbsp; For some time he stood
amongst the rest, scarce knowing what to do, neither liking to 
remain nor daring to go; until at last, as some more stragglers 
joined themselves to the company, he slunk away like one ashamed,
without stopping even to fill the water-vessels he had 
brought.</p>
<p>And so he entered his own door, heavy-hearted and trembling; 
and he went to the prophet&rsquo;s chamber, for he deemed that he
still slept.&nbsp; But the man of God was risen; and he knew, 
therefore, where he should find him&mdash;that he would be <!-- 
page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
156</span>upon the flat roof of his house, calling upon the name 
of the Lord his God, who had made another morning&rsquo;s sun to 
rise in its glory.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p156.jpg">
<img alt="The Prophet&rsquo;s Guard" src="images/p156.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>So he followed his master to the housetop; and there, even as 
he had supposed, he found the holy man.&nbsp; It was a striking 
sight, could any one have seen the difference between these two 
men.&nbsp; The one pale and trembling and affrighted, like a man 
out of himself, and with no stay on which to rest his mind; the 
other calm and earnest, as, in deep and solemn prayer, with his 
head bowed and his hands clasped together, his low voice poured 
forth his thanksgiving, or spake of his needs; he also, as it 
seemed, was out of himself, but going out of himself that he 
might rest upon One who was near to him though his eye saw Him 
not, and who spake to him though his outward ear heard no voice 
of words.</p>
<p>Thus he continued for a season, as if <!-- page 157--><a 
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>he knew not
that any man was nigh unto him; as if he knew not that there 
were, in the great world around him, any one besides his God with
whom he communed, and his own soul which spake unto his 
God.&nbsp; All this time his servant stood by him, pale and 
trembling, but not daring to break in upon that hour of prayer; 
until at length the prophet paused, and his eye fell upon the 
trembler; and he turned towards him, and said kindly, &ldquo;What
ails thee, my son?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the servant answered, 
&ldquo;O my father, look unto the hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he stood
gazing in the prophet&rsquo;s face, as though he expected to see 
paleness and terror overspread it when his eyes gathered in the 
sight of those angry hosts.&nbsp; But it was not so.&nbsp; No 
change passed over his countenance; his brow was open as it was 
before; the colour never left his cheeks; and, with almost a 
smile, he turned unto the servant, and said, &ldquo;And why does 
this <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>affright thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It is for thee they seek, my father&mdash;it is for thee 
they seek; and the wicked men of the town are ready to fall upon 
thee and deliver thee into their hands.&nbsp; Even now, as I 
walked along the street, they looked on me with fierce and cruel 
eyes; and they breathed threats which these lips may not utter, 
and said, that thou hadst brought this trouble upon them, and 
their wives, and their little ones; and I feared that they would 
curse thee and thy God.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the prophet was not 
moved by his words, for he only answered, &ldquo;Fear them not; 
they that are with us are more than they that are against 
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then did the servant cast his eyes to the 
ground, and he spake not, yet his lips moved; and if any one had 
heard the words which he whispered, they might perhaps have heard
him ask how this could be, when they were but two, and their 
enemies were so many and so mighty.</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>Now the prophet&rsquo;s eye rested upon him, and he 
read all his secret thoughts; and he pitied his weakness, for 
that holy man was full of pity for the weak: so he chid him not; 
but, bowing his knees again on that flat roof, he prayed unto his
God to open the eyes of his affrighted servant.&nbsp; His prayer 
was heard.&nbsp; For there fell from them as it were films; and 
now, when he looked out, he saw a glorious sight.&nbsp; All the 
mountain was full; and they were a wonderful company which filled
it.&nbsp; The dark hosts of the Syrians, and their glancing 
swords and clashing chariots, now looked but as a mere handful; 
for the whole mountain round them was full of that heavenly 
army.&nbsp; Chariots of fire and horsemen of fire thronged it in 
every part.&nbsp; High up into the viewless air mounted their 
wheeling bands: rank beyond rank, and army beyond army, they 
seemed to stretch on into the vastness of space, until the 
gazer&rsquo;s wearied eye was unable to gaze <!-- page 160--><a 
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>on 
them.&nbsp; And all of these were gathered round his 
master.&nbsp; They were God&rsquo;s host, keeping guard over 
God&rsquo;s servant.&nbsp; And they who would injure him must 
first turn aside those flashing swords, must break up that strong
and serried array, and be able to do battle with God&rsquo;s 
mighty angels.</p>
<p>Then was the weak heart strong.&nbsp; Then did the poor 
trembler see that he was safe; and know that he who is on 
God&rsquo;s side can never want companions and defenders.</p>
<h2><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>The Brothers&rsquo; Meeting;<br />
<span class="smcap">or</span>,<br />
The Sins of Youth.</h2>
<p>A large company was winding its way slowly out of the vale in 
which the river Jordan runs.&nbsp; The sun was just beginning to 
strike hotly upon them, and make them long for rest and shelter, 
as they toiled up the open sandy hills and amongst the great 
masses of rock with which that country was strewn.</p>
<p>It was a striking sight to see those travellers.&nbsp; First 
went three troops of kine, lowing as they went; camels with their
arched necks, stooping shoulders, and forward ears; asses with 
their foals; ewes and lambs; and goats with their <!-- page 
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
162</span>kids, which mounted idly upon every rock that lay by 
their road-side, and then jumped as idly down again; and before 
and after these, drivers in stately turbans and long flowing 
robes, keeping the flocks and herds to their appointed way.&nbsp;
Then came large droves of cattle, and sheep, and goats, and 
asses, stirring up with their many feet the dust of the sandy 
plain, till it fell like a gentle shower powdering with its small
grains all the rough and prickly plants which grew in tufts over 
the waste.&nbsp; Then was there a space; and after that were seen
two bands of camels,&mdash;the best they seemed to be of all the 
flock, those which came last especially,&mdash;and on them were 
children and women riding, over whom hung long veils to shelter 
their faces from the hot breath of the sandy desert through which
they had travelled.&nbsp; And after all these came one man, with 
his staff in his hand and a turban on his head, walking slowly, 
as <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>one who walked in pain and yet walked on, following 
those who went before.</p>
<p>If you had stood near to that man, you might, perhaps, have 
heard him speaking to God in prayer and thanksgiving; you might 
have heard him saying to himself, &ldquo;with my staff passed I 
over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands:&rdquo; or you 
might have heard him earnestly calling upon the God of Abraham, 
and the God of Isaac his father, to keep him safe in the great 
danger which now lay close before him.&nbsp; His mind was 
certainly very full of that danger; for he kept looking up from 
the sand on which his eyes were often fixed, and gazing as far as
he could see over the hills before him, as if he expected to see 
some great danger suddenly meet him on his way, and as if, 
therefore, he wished to be quite ready for it.</p>
<p>If you looked into his face, you could see at once that he was
not a common <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>man.&nbsp; He was not a very old 
man; his hair was not yet grey upon his head; and yet it seemed, 
at the first glance, as if he was very old.&nbsp; But as you 
looked closer, you saw that it was not so; but that many, many 
thoughts had passed through his mind, and left those deep marks 
stamped even on his face.&nbsp; It was not only sorrow, though 
there was much of that; nor care, though he was now full of care;
but besides these, it seemed as if he had seen, and done, and 
felt great things&mdash;things in which all a man&rsquo;s soul is
called up, and so, which leave their impress behind them, even 
when they have passed away.</p>
<p>He <span class="smcap">had</span> seen great things, and felt 
great things.&nbsp; He had seen God&rsquo;s most holy angels 
going up to heaven, and coming down to earth upon their messages 
of mercy.&nbsp; He had heard the voice of the Lord of all, 
promising to be his Father and his Friend.&nbsp; And only the 
night before, <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>the Angel of the covenant had made 
himself known to him in the stillness of his lonely tent, and 
made him strong to wrestle with him for a blessing, until the 
breaking of the day.&nbsp; So that it was no wonder, that when 
you looked into his face, it was not like the face of a common 
man, but one which was full of thought, which bore almost 
outwardly the stamp of great mysteries.</p>
<p>But what was it which now filled this man with care?&nbsp; He 
was returning home from a far land where he had been staying 
twenty years, to the land where his father dwelt.&nbsp; He had 
gone out a poor man; he was coming home a rich man.&nbsp; He was 
bringing back with him his wives, and his children, and his 
servants, and his flocks, and his herds; and of what was he 
afraid?&nbsp; Surely he could trust the God who had kept him and 
blessed him all these twenty years, and who had led him now so 
far on his journey?</p>
<p><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>Why should he fear now, when he was almost at his 
father&rsquo;s tent?</p>
<p>It was because he heard that <span class="smcap">his 
brother</span> was coming to meet him.&nbsp; But why should this 
fill him with such fear?&nbsp; Surely it would be a happy 
meeting; brothers born of the same father and of the same mother,
who had dwelt together in one tent, kneeled before one 
father&rsquo;s knees in prayer, and joined together in the common
plays of childhood,&mdash;surely their meeting must be happy, now
that they have been twenty years asunder, and God has blessed 
them both, and they are about to see each other again in peace 
and safety, and to shew to each other the children whom God had 
given them, and who must remind them of their days of common 
childhood.&nbsp; And why then is the man afraid?&nbsp; Because 
when he left his father&rsquo;s house this brother was very angry
with him, and he fears that he may have remembered his anger all 
these twenty years, and be <!-- page 167--><a 
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>ready now 
to revenge himself for that old quarrel.</p>
<p>And yet, why should this make such an one to fear?&nbsp; Even 
if his brother be still angry with him, and have cruel and evil 
thoughts against him, cannot God deliver him?&mdash;cannot the 
same God who has kept him safely all these twenty years of toil 
and labour, help and save him now?&nbsp; Why then does he fear so
greatly?&nbsp; He has not forgotten that this God can save 
him&mdash;he has not for a moment forgotten it; for see how 
earnestly he makes his prayer unto Him: hear his vows that if God
will again deliver him, he and all of his shall ever praise and 
serve him for this mercy.&nbsp; Yet still he is in fear; and he 
seems like a man who thought that there was some reason why the 
God who had heard him in other cases should not hear him in 
this.</p>
<p>What was it, then, which pressed so heavily upon this 
man&rsquo;s mind?&nbsp; It was <!-- page 168--><a 
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the 
remembrance of an old sin.&nbsp; He feared that God would leave 
him now to Esau&rsquo;s wrath, because he knew that Esau&rsquo;s 
wrath was God&rsquo;s punishment of his sin.&nbsp; He feared that
Esau&rsquo;s hand would slay his children, as God&rsquo;s 
chastisement for the sins of his childhood.&nbsp; He remembered 
that he had lied to Isaac his father, and mocked the dimness of 
his aged eyes by a false appearance; now he trembled lest his 
father&rsquo;s God should leave the deceiver and the mocker to 
eat the bitter fruit of his old sin.&nbsp; It was not so much 
Esau&rsquo;s wrath, and Esau&rsquo;s company, and Esau&rsquo;s 
arms, which he feared&mdash;though all these were very terrible 
to this peaceful man,&mdash;as it was his own sin in days long 
past, which now met him again, and seemed to frown upon him from 
the darkness before him.&nbsp; In vain did he strive to look on 
and see whether God would guide him there, for his sin clouded 
over the light of God&rsquo;s countenance.&nbsp; It was as when 
<!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
169</span>he strained his eyes into the great sand-drifts of the 
desert through which he had passed: they danced and whirled 
fearfully before him, and baffled all the strivings of his 
earnest gaze.</p>
<p>But the time of trial was drawing very near.&nbsp; And how did
it end?&nbsp; Instead of falling upon him and slaying him and 
his; instead of making a spoil of the oxen, and the asses, and 
the camels, and giving the young children to the sword, 
Esau&rsquo;s heart melted as soon as they met; he fell upon his 
brother&rsquo;s neck and kissed him; he looked lovingly upon the 
children who had been born to him in the far land; he spake 
kindly of the old days of their remembered childhood, of the 
grey-haired man at home; and he would not take even the present 
which his brother had set apart for him.</p>
<p>Jacob knew who it was that had turned his brother&rsquo;s 
heart, and he felt more than ever what a strong and blessed thing
prayer <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>and supplication was.&nbsp; Nor did 
he forget his childhood&rsquo;s sin against his God.&nbsp; It had
looked out again upon him in manhood, and reminded him of 
God&rsquo;s holiness, of his many past misdeeds, and made him 
pray more earnestly not to be made to &ldquo;possess the 
iniquities of his youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><i>Father</i>.&nbsp; What should we learn from this account of
Jacob&rsquo;s meeting Esau?</p>
<p><i>Child</i>.&nbsp; That God remembers and often visits long 
afterwards the sins of our childhood.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; Does not God, then, forgive the sins of children?</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; Yes, He does forgive them, and blot them out for 
Christ&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; Why, then, do we say that He visits them?</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; Because He often allows the effects of past sins to 
be still their punishment, even when He has forgiven them.</p>
<p><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>F.&nbsp; Why does He do so?</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; To shew us how He hates sin.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; What should we learn from this?</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; To watch against every sin most carefully, because we
never can know what may be its effects; to remember how God has 
punished it, often for years, in His true servants; to pray 
against sin; to think no sin little.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; What should we do, if we find the consequences of 
past sin coming upon us?</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; Take our chastisement meekly; humble ourselves under 
God&rsquo;s hand; pray for deliverance, as, &ldquo;Remember not 
the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy 
mercy remember thou me for thy goodness&rsquo; sake, O 
Lord&rdquo; (Ps. xxv. 7).</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; What should be the effect on us when God hears our 
prayer, and delivers us?</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; It should make us more humbly remember <!-- page 
172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
172</span>our sins and unworthiness, and strive to shew forth our
thankfulness, &ldquo;not with our lips only, but in our 
lives.&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
